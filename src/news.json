      "content": "Trafigura Group’s head of oil trading Ben Luckock has named U.S. foreign policy towards Iran as the biggest upside risk to crude prices in an otherwise well supplied market.“ ” Luckock said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “ .” Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump’s first sanctions against Iran targeted 3 vessels carrying Iranian crude to China. The sanctions affected one very large crude carrier (VLCC) and two Aframaxes that the Treasury Department said helped move Iranian oil to China. They also targeted several entities and individuals across different countries involved in the trade, on behalf of Tehran’s Armed Forces General Staff and its sanctioned front company, Sepehr Energy Jahan Nama Pars. On Tuesday, the Trump administration imposed further sanctions on more than 30 people and vessels for selling and transporting Iranian petroleum related products as part of the country’s\"shadow fleet\". The latest sanctions target tanker operators and managers in India and China; oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Hong Kong and the head of Iran's National Iranian Oil Company. Last year, Trump in his Republican National Convention speech to dramatically lower Iranian oil exports, saying he previously achieved this by linking it to trade; “ China has been importing Iranian oil indirectly via proxies. According to multiple media sources, the transfers involve a dark fleet consisting of a group of aging tankers that rarely have an identifiable insurer. These transfers can be hazardous, including the danger of spills and collisions, with so many low quality tankers massed in a narrow trade route with their transponders off.",

      "content": "Vitry le François, France – February 26, 2025, 6:00 PM (CEST) Commissioning of the world’s first plant producing hydrogen from solid biomass at the Marolles site (Champagne region, France). Unique thermochemical process that significantly reduces green hydrogen costs. “Super green” 1 hydrogen available for commercial use beginning the second half of 2025. Haffner Energy (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 – Ticker: ALHAF) announces the commencement of hydrogen 2 production utilizing its proprietary solid biomass thermolysis technology at its Marolles hydrogen production, testing, and training center, as was announced in the 12/17/2024 press release . This unique technology enables the production of renewable hydrogen at a substantially lower cost compared to conventional methods, while offering an unparalleled carbon footprint. “ Achieving the continuous production of competitive green hydrogen is a decisive step. Currently, the industry faces significant delays due to the excessive cost of decarbonized hydrogen. We are confident that our solution will accelerate the adoption of renewable hydrogen and enhance the sector’s competitiveness. I want to congratulate the Haffner Energy team and our partners for this remarkable achievement, ushering the company into a new era ,” stated Philippe Haffner, Co founder and CEO of Haffner Energy. A Flexible and Economically Advantageous Production Model The site’s production capacity will be 15 kg of hydrogen per hour (kg/h), with an initial phase temporarily limited to 11 kg/h due to the existing PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) purification equipment. This equipment will be replaced in the coming months by a PSA designed to reach a 15 kg/h capacity. The unit already produces hydrogen at 8 bar pressure, ready for commercial distribution starting in the second half of 2025 to serve transportation and industrial markets. Anticipated since late 2024, this commissioning required the site to be connected to the medium voltage electrical grid, which was completed earlier this year, followed by the on site presence of commissioning engineers focused on the main equipment suppliers for hydrogen purification. The biomass thermolysis unit, operational since June 2024, exceeds the capacity required to produce 15 kg/h of hydrogen . The new PSA, already received by Haffner Energy, will be complemented by a compressor reaching 35 bar pressure, supplying an H14 distribution station provided by HRS. Marolles is designed to operate 8,000 hours per year. As part of this site's operations, 120 metric tons of mobility grade hydrogen per year (15 kg/hour) will be produced, contributing to the decarbonization of mobility and industry. This is equivalent to 12 million kilometers traveled with hydrogen vehicles. Approximately 2,400 metric tons of CO2 per year will be avoided or captured through hydrogen and biocarbon (char or biochar) combined. A memorandum of understanding for the offtake has been signed for the supply of 90 tonnes of hydrogen per year, mainly for mobility applications, which is designed to ensure a commercial outlet within the next few months. Hydrogen Production from Residual Solid Biomass: A Game Changer The scaling up of Haffner Energy’s proprietary biomass thermolysis technology is poised to disrupt the global and French renewable hydrogen markets , facilitating accelerated commercial and industrial development. This technology offers several key advantages: Economically Competitive Solution: Already capable of competing with gray hydrogen for installations of 20 MW and above – a feat far from achievable by alternative technologies. Economic Model Based on Low Cost Biomass Energy: Hydrogen from biomass thermolysis is significantly cheaper to produce than hydrogen from the electrolysis of water thanks to low primary energy costs (70€/MWh for decarbonized electricity) and optimal energy efficiency (generally >70%). Independence from the Electrical Grid: Unlike electrolysis, thermolysis is minimally dependent on electricity availability and cost, ensuring stable and predictable production. Negative Carbon Footprint : This technology sequesters biogenic carbon through biochar co production, achieving a negative carbon footprint when considering the full LCA. 3 Flexible Sourcing: This biomass agnostic technology is able to utilize various residual biomasses, in particular from agriculture, ensuring greater autonomy and resilience against feedstock market fluctuations while significantly expanding available resources. Towards Commercial and Industrial Expansion The commissioning of the Marolles unit marks a strategic milestone for Haffner Energy. This success accelerates commercial discussions with several partners interested in this disruptive technology and, as announced in previous communications, will enable the Company's project pipeline to be converted into firm orders , thereby generating revenue . In particular, the effective commissioning of the site is a catalyst for finalizing the signing of two major contracts. The continuous operation of hydrogen and renewable gas production equipment on site will also enable Haffner Energy’s team to conduct tests using specific biomasses for each potential client, including non conventional biomasses such as organic sludge, manure, and algae, thereby confirming the compatibility of Haffner Energy’s technology. Furthermore, Haffner Energy is now positioned to leverage a previously untapped technological solution that converts hydrogen into electricity at an extremely competitive cost , highly valuable during peak consumption periods. Despite a global context that remains unfavorable to the development of the hydrogen market, particularly in Europe and in France—where the national hydrogen strategy has yet to be announced—Haffner Energy’s position in this high potential market is now strengthened.

Biocarbon contains biogenic carbon absorbed from the atmosphere by plants via photosynthesis. This characteristic makes it a major carbon sink when used as a soil amendment, either applied directly or incorporated into fertilizers (known as biochar), or incorporated into building materials (known as char). Biocarbon is also a very dense source of renewable energy (31 MJ/kg) that can be gasified on site to increase the production of biofuels such as bio SAF or the production of renewable hydrogen, but can also be shipped and gasified at another site, notably for the production of e fuels. 1 In accordance with the order of July 1, 2024 specifying the greenhouse gas emission threshold and the methodology for qualifying hydrogen as renewable or low carbon. 2 Samples were taken today by an independent laboratory to validate the mobility quality of this hydrogen. 3 In accordance with the life cycle assessment study carried out by the LCA consultancy EVEA at the end of 2021.

      "content": "EXCLUSIVE : Magnolia Pictures has acquired U.S. rights to The Assessment , a sci fi thriller starring Alicia Vikander ( Ex Machina ), Elizabeth Olsen ( His Three Daughters ) and Himesh Patel ( Station Eleven ), which will be released in theaters on March 21, after world premiering at last year’s Toronto Film Festival. Marking the feature directorial debut of veteran music video helmer Fleur Fortuné , the film follows Mia (Olsen) and Aaryan (Patel), a successful couple who hope to become parents in a near future where resources are extremely limited and the government keeps firm control over reproduction. In looking to do so, the pair are assigned an assessor named Virginia (Vikander), who moves into their home for seven days to evaluate whether they deserve to move forward in their parenting journey. What Mia and Aaryan are hoping is a routine test quickly unravels into a psychological nightmare, forcing them to question the very foundations of their society and what it truly means to be human.

Fleur has fashioned an incredibly imaginative world that feels terrifyingly believable.” Watch on Deadline Fortuné shared that she is “thrilled” by Magnolia’s move to release the film in theaters, adding, “They have always made bold choices, giving a voice to some of my favorite filmmakers, who make us think and have a different perspective on the world.” Written by Thomas and John Donnelly, The Assessment also stars Minnie Driver ( Good Will Hunting ), Indira Varma ( Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ), Nicholas Pinnock ( Captain America: The First Avenger ), Charlotte Ritchie ( Wonka ), and Leah Harvey ( Foundation ).

      "description": "New BrightEdge report reveals how DeepSeek’s innovative approach to search is reshaping the landscape and what it means for brands and marketers New BrightEdge report reveals how DeepSeek’s innovative approach to search is reshaping the landscape and what it means for brands and marketers",
      "content": "SAN MATEO, Calif., Feb. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)    BrightEdge, the global leader in AI driven organic search, content, and digital marketing automation, today unveiled a new report examining the rapid rise of DeepSeek, a groundbreaking AI powered search platform. The report highlights how DeepSeek’s novel approach to search is reshaping traditional and AI search engines while leaving Google’s commanding 92% market share largely unchallenged. Additionally, the report unpacks how brands and marketers can adapt in this new age of AI driven search to own their share of conversation. Since launching in late January, DeepSeek’s chatbot app has surpassed 10 million downloads, with referral traffic already at a similar level to OpenAI's SearchGPT beta. BrightEdge anticipates continued referral growth and an expanding market share for DeepSeek in the coming months. DeepSeek’s Novel Approach: Searching On User’s Behalf Unlike AI search platforms like Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity and Bing Copilot, DeepSeek takes an open source approach while prioritizing contextually rich responses and lower processing power. But beyond these differences, BrightEdge’s analysis reveals three other, fundamental ways DeepSeek disrupts the search experience: A “Think First” Approach: Before beginning its search process, DeepSeek will consider how to best find an answer to a question. For example, DeepSeek’s understanding of recency or immediacy will shape where it looks for answers to a query. This differs from other AI Search platforms that take a \"Get Content First, Think Second” approach. Real Time, Multi Source Content Exploration: Once DeepSeek begins its search, it does not pull from a singular search index, and does not have a proprietary search index like Google, Perplexity, and other AI search engines do. Instead, it navigates multiple sources in real time to construct a more comprehensive response. Transparent Thinking: When ready with an answer, DeepSeek shows its reasoning and where it is collating information from by providing citations, a major shift from black box AI models that offer little visibility into their decision making. This approach is likely to increase trust in the results and help users rephrase their search or follow ups if needed. By dynamically evaluating, sourcing and explaining, DeepSeek isn’t just a search engine— it functions more like a highly intelligent research assistant, establishing a fundamentally new way of searching. What DeepSeek Means for Search Industry Players While BrightEdge found that January referrals exceed November levels for all AI search engines, except for Claude which has experienced three consecutive months of decline, DeepSeek’s new standard for AI discoverability carries profound and lasting implications for the search industry. With its technology freely available for adaptation and implementation, some like Perplexity are already integrating DeepSeek into their search engine. Others, like OpenAI, must reckon with whether DeepSeek’s approach disrupts its current footprint or if it can continue innovating without compromising profitability. But despite ChatGPT and Perplexity seeing month over month increases of 17% and 16%, respectively, BrightEdge found no signal of any single competitor—or group of competitors—eroding Google’s dominance of nearly 92% of market share. \"With DeepSeek’s innovations in search and efficiencies proving previously unworkable approaches viable, Google could emerge as a surprise winner,” said Jim Yu, CEO and co founder of BrightEdge. “DeepSeek’s 'do it for me’ search model is a major shift, and if Google leverages these innovations in time, with its massive user base and resources, it may benefit the most.\" What This Means for Brands and Marketers DeepSeek’s approach will also have a rippling impact on SEO strategies. Because AI uses the same engines, index approaches, and understanding of site and content authority, established SEO practices are a great foundation to build from. But brands must expand their focus beyond how they appear in traditional search results, and into how they fit within the broader conversations that AI systems understand. Marketers must understand the various touch points of AI discovery and maximize their brand’s share of conversation. BrightEdge’s report analyzes DeepSeek queries across industries such as e commerce, education, and restaurants, and provides actionable insights for brands and marketers to maximize their share of conversation in AI powered search experiences.

      "content": "Vitry le François, France – 26 février 2025, 18h00 (CEST) Mise en route de la première unité mondiale de production continue d’hydrogène à partir de biomasse solide sur le site de Marolles (Marne, Région Grand Est). Un procédé thermochimique unique qui change la donne, permettant de réduire fortement le coût de l’hydrogène vert. Un hydrogène « super vert » 1 , commercialisé dès le second semestre 2025. Haffner Energy (ISIN : FR0014007ND6 – Mémo : ALHAF) annonce la mise en production d’hydrogène 2 à partir de sa technologie propriétaire de thermolyse de la biomasse solide sur son centre de production d’hydrogène, d’essais et de formation de Marolles, tel qu’annoncé dans le communiqué de presse du 17 décembre 2024 . Cette technologie unique permet de produire un hydrogène renouvelable à un coût nettement réduit par rapport aux solutions conventionnelles connues, tout en offrant une empreinte carbone inégalée. « Avec la production continue d’hydrogène vert compétitif, nous franchissons une étape décisive. Actuellement, le développement de la filière reste fortement retardé par le coût excessif de l’hydrogène décarboné. Nous sommes convaincus que notre solution va accélérer l’adoption de l’hydrogène renouvelable et renforcer la compétitivité du secteur. Je tiens à féliciter les équipes de Haffner Energy et nos partenaires pour cette réussite qui fait entrer la Société dans une nouvelle ère de son histoire », déclare Philippe Haffner, Co fondateur et PDG de Haffner Energy. Un modèle de production flexible et économiquement avantageux La capacité de production du site sera de 15 kg d’hydrogène par heure (kg/h), avec une première phase provisoire limitée à une capacité de 11 kg/h par l’équipement de purification PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption ou adsorption à pression modulée) actuellement installé sur le site. Cet équipement sera remplacé dans les mois à venir par un PSA permettant d’atteindre la capacité de 15 kg/h. Cette unité permet d’ores et déjà de produire de l’hydrogène pur à une pression de 8 bar, prête à être commercialisée dès le second semestre 2025 pour alimenter les marchés du transport et de l’industrie dès lors que le compresseur et la station de distribution seront raccordés et en service. Cette mise en service était attendue depuis la fin de l’année 2024 mais elle impliquait le raccordement de l’installation au réseau électrique moyenne tension, effectif depuis le début de l’année, puis la présence sur le site des ingénieurs de mise en service auprès des fournisseurs des principaux équipements pour la purification de l’hydrogène. L’unité de thermolyse de la biomasse, mise en service en juin 2024, dépasse la capacité nécessaire pour produire 15 kg/h d’hydrogène . Le nouveau PSA, déjà réceptionné par Haffner Energy, sera complété par un compresseur permettant d’atteindre la pression de 35 bar qui alimentera une station de distribution H14 commandée à la société HRS. Le site de Marolles est destiné à fonctionner 8 000 heures par an. Il permettra de produire, dans le cadre de ses opérations, 120 tonnes d’hydrogène qualité mobilité par an (15 kg/h) qui contribueront à la décarbonation des mobilités et de l’industrie. Ceci représente l’équivalent de 12 millions de kilomètres parcourus avec des véhicules à hydrogène. Environ 2 400 tonnes de CO 2 par an seront évitées ou capturées, en conjuguant l’hydrogène et le biocarbone (char ou biochar). Un protocole d’accord pour l’offtake a d’ailleurs été signé pour la fourniture de 90 tonnes d’hydrogène par an essentiellement destinés à la mobilité, destiné à assurer ainsi un débouché commercial dans les tous prochains mois. La production d’hydrogène à partir de résidus de biomasse solide, une innovation de rupture La montée en puissance de la technologie de thermolyse de la biomasse développée par Haffner Energy constitue un élément disruptif sur le marché de l’hydrogène renouvelable dans le monde et en France , apte à faciliter l’accélération de son développement commercial et industriel. Cette technologie, présente en effet des atouts majeurs : Une solution économiquement compétitive, d’ores et déjà capable de rivaliser avec l’hydrogène gris pour les installations de 20 MW et au delà, ce qui est loin d’être le cas des technologies alternatives. Un modèle économique fondé sur le coût réduit de la biomasse énergie : L’hydrogène issu de la thermolyse de biomasse coûte significativement moins cher à produire que l’hydrogène issu de l’électrolyse de l’eau, grâce à une énergie primaire peu onéreuse (70€/MWh pour l’électricité décarbonée) et une efficacité énergétique optimale (généralement >70%). Une indépendance vis à vis du réseau électrique : Contrairement à l’électrolyse, la thermolyse ne dépend que très peu de la disponibilité et du coût de l’électricité, garantissant ainsi une production stable et prévisible. Une empreinte carbone négative : En co produisant du biochar , cette technologie permet de séquestrer du carbone biogénique, permettant d’atteindre une empreinte carbone négative en analyse complète de cycle de vie 3 . Une flexibilité d’approvisionnement : Par sa capacité à valoriser tous les types de résidus de biomasse, notamment agricoles, cette technologie assure une autonomie et une résilience accrues face aux fluctuations des marchés de la biomasse tout en élargissant fortement le gisement disponible. Vers une expansion commerciale et industrielle L’entrée en production de l’unité de Marolles marque une étape stratégique pour Haffner Energy. Ce succès accélère les discussions commerciales avec plusieurs partenaires intéressés par cette technologie disruptive et permettra, comme annoncé lors des précédentes communications, de convertir le pipeline de projets de la société en commandes fermes et de générer ainsi du chiffre d’affaires. La mise en service effective du site constitue en effet un élément déclencheur pour finaliser la signature de deux contrats majeurs. Le fonctionnement en continu des équipements de production d’hydrogène et de gaz renouvelables sur site permettra également aux équipes de Haffner Energy de réaliser les tests à partir des biomasses spécifiques de chaque client potentiel, y compris des biomasses non conventionnelles telles que boues organiques, lisiers et algues, leur permettant ainsi de confirmer leur compatibilité avec la technologie Haffner Energy. Enfin, Haffner Energy est désormais en capacité de mettre à profit une solution technologique jusqu’alors inexploitée permettant de convertir l’hydrogène en électricité à un coût extrêmement compétitif , fortement valorisable lors des pointes de consommation. En dépit d’un contexte global qui demeure peu propice au développement du marché de l’hydrogène, notamment en Europe et en France où la Stratégie Nationale Hydrogène n’est toujours pas publiée, Haffner Energy voit ainsi sa position renforcée sur ce marché à fort potentiel.

      "content": "Italian automobile major Stellantis NV STLA stock is trading lower on Wednesday after it reported its full year 2024 earnings. The Fiat Chrysler parent reported a 17% year on year revenue decline to 156.9 billion Euros ($164.7 billion) in FY24. North America shipments were down 25% due to reduced production and revenues fell 27%, primarily due to lower volumes from discontinued models of Dodge Charger and Challenger, Chrysler 300, and Jeep Cherokee and Renegade. Also Read : Tesla Acquires German Tech Firm Manz Assets Amid Insolvency Enlarged Europe shipments dropped 8%, driven by a reduction in dealer stock from H1 ’24, as well as production losses due to the delayed launch of vehicles utilizing the Smart Car platform. Revenue decreased 11%. Adjusted operating income dived 64% to 8.64 billion euros, and the adjusted operating income margin contracted 730 basis points to 5.5%. Net profit for the year plunged 70% to 5.520 billion euros, with a 61% drop in adjusted EPS to 2.48 euros. Total inventories on December 31, 2024, were 18% or 268 thousand units lower Y/Y, including a 20% drop in U.S. dealer stock to 304 thousand units, surpassing the previously communicated target of 330 thousand units. Operating cash flow for the twelve months totaled 4 billion euros, down from 22.48 billion euros. Stellantis plans to pay a dividend of 68 cents per common share, pending shareholder approval. The company held 34.1 billion euros in cash and equivalents as of December 31. Stellantis said the process to appoint the new permanent Chief Executive Officer is well underway and will be concluded within the first half of 2025. “ While 2024 was a year of stark contrasts for the company, with results falling short of our potential, we achieved important strategic milestones. Notably, we began the rollout of new multi energy platforms and products, which continues in 2025, started production of EV batteries through our JVs, and launched the Leapmotor International partnership,” said Chairman John Elkann . Outlook : For FY25, Stellantis sees positive net revenue growth and industrial free cash flows. The company anticipates FY25 adjusted operating income margin in the mid single digits . Price Action : At the last check on Wednesday, STLA shares were trading lower by 3.67% to $13.52.

      "content": "Shares of Krispy Kreme ( DNUT  8.27% ) continued to sink on Wednesday after dropping by more than 20% on Tuesday. As of 11:50 a.m. ET, the stock was down by about 8.6%. Why analysts are lowering their expectations The doughnut purveyor issued its fourth quarter report before the opening bell on Tuesday, and on Wednesday morning, multiple Wall Street analysts were issuing downbeat reports and lowering their price targets for its stock. Investing news website The Fly reported that Piper Sandler analyst Brian Mullan cut his price target for the stock by 33% to $12 per share. Morgan Stanley 's analysts were more aggressive, slashing their price target in half to just $6 per share. Krispy Kreme missed expectations on the top and bottom lines in Q4, which was bad enough. But even the high end of management's revenue guidance range for 2025 is modestly lower than it booked in 2024. This goes against what analysts had been expecting. The general notion had been that demand for Krispy Kreme is strong, and that the company's moves to expand distribution would lead to growth. Now, growth is apparently off the table for 2025, so analysts are dialing back their price targets. Krispy Kreme simply needs more growth If Krispy Kreme's \"hot now\" donuts ever come to my hometown, I'll be the first in line to buy a dozen, but as much as I love the product, I appreciate investors' current apprehensions about the stock. The company is carrying a heavy debt load and its profit margins are thin, making growth a crucial component of the investment thesis . It has promise, particularly thanks to its growing partnership with McDonald's . But until Krispy Kreme can deliver greater sales growth, its stock will be unlikely to provide any meaningful gains for shareholders.",

A corrected full version of the February 18 news release is attached below. ====== Full text of Corrected News Release dated February 18 ======== VAYK Confirms No Dilution Following Recent Acquisition and 11 Million Insider Purchase ( Atlanta, Georgia , February 18, 2025 ) – Vaycaychella, Inc. VAYK (\"VAYK\") confirmed today that the company's common shares will not experience any dilution upon the closing of its recent acquisition of a $1 million company. 1. No Dilution Until 24 Months Later & Above $0.005 PPS \"We completed this no cash acquisition by issuing to the seller preferred shares with a total face value of $500,000 ,\" explained Stephanie Anderl , interim CEO of VAYK. \"These preferred shares are non tradable. They can only be converted after 24 months or when our stocks are stably traded above $0.005 per share.\" Even when those shares become eligible for conversion, the conversion will be conducted at a fixed price of $0.005 per share. Therefore, any shareholder who has purchased or will purchase VAYK stocks below the price of $0.005 will experience no dilution, and will instead enjoy a premium. \"Our common stocks closed at $0.0008 per share yesterday, which is less than 1/6 of these preferred shares' conversion price. In other words, the conversion price is 6.25 times higher than our current share price,\" said Anderl. 2. No Free tradable Shares issued for Almost 3 Years In fact, VAYK has not issued any free tradable shares since May 2022 , which is almost 3 years ago. The company has only delivered two issuances of restricted shares since then. These include approximately 43 million restricted shares issued at a price of $0.0073 , which is 9.1 times higher than the current share price. The other issuance is 20 million restricted shares issued at a price of $0.0008 , but those shares are not eligible for trading until July 2026 . Anderl emphasized that the company is committed to not issuing any free tradable shares until its share price rebounds to a \"reasonable level\". \"We understand that people will have different opinion on what a reasonable level should be,\" said Anderl. \"Let me put it in this way: we believe that it is unreasonable for a company to issue low cost shares to flood the market, when there are still substantial number of investors who have purchased our shares in the last 3 years are under water.\" 3. Insider Purchase of Over 11 Million Shares Additionally, Anderl disclosed that a person who holds insider information has purchased more than 11 million shares on the open market since last November. \"The insider made those purchases because they believed there were no other channels to acquire our common shares at the current price level,\" elaborate Anderl. \"As our disclosure has shown, the company has not issued any low cost shares in the past three years and will definitely not issue any free tradable shares at the current market level. Anyone who wants to own shares at the current market price level will have to buy from the open market.\" Anderl shares that the insider has expressed their intention to purchase more share on the open market, but has given no indication about the timing and volume of future purchases. Also, since VAYK is not SEC reporting, insider trading will not be disclosed on Form 4 or Form 5 but will be disclosed alternatively.

      "content": "Cal Maine Foods ( CALM 1.53% ) stock flew more than 7% higher in early trading Wednesday before settling back to roost on a 2.7% gain as of 10:55 a.m. ET. America's largest producer of eggs in the shell , Cal Maine appears to be reacting to bombshell news from the Trump administration: To solve the egg shortage, we're importing eggs. How to beat avian flu Fears over avian flu infecting U.S. chickens and spreading to humans led the Biden administration to order the killing of upward of 140 million egg laying hens over the past three years. This depleted egg laying flocks, causing an undersupply of eggs    and Econ 101 teaches us that when demand is constant but supply falls, prices rise. To mitigate this problem, Turkey was already planning to sell the U.S. 420 million eggs this year. CNN says Turkey is the only place we import eggs from, and 420 million would be about six times our imports from Turkey in 2024. Even so, it's only enough to replace the output of about 1.4 million U.S. hens. To close that gap, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced a plan today to invest \"up to $1 billion to curb this crisis.\" USDA will review regulations that increase farmers' cost of egg production. It will invest $100 million in new vaccines for chickens. $400 million will subsidize egg producers whose flocks have been decimated. $500 million will support \"biosecurity measures\" to prevent further avian flu outbreaks. Last but not least, the U.S. \"will consider temporary import options to reduce egg costs in the short term,\" expanding the list of countries from which we import eggs from Turkey alone to three or four others. What does this mean for Cal Maine? It's unclear what additional imports will mean for Cal Maine, but $1 billion in government subsidies and spending to promote egg production will almost certainly lower the company's costs and improve its profits. It may be hard to say precisely how good this news is for Cal Maine, but it's almost certain to be good news, period.",

      "content": "MCDONALD’S has enforced an unusual new rule at one of its restaurants, similar to the ID check policy at warehouse club Costco.The fast food chain is now requiring diners to present their IDs before entering to verify their age, alerting customers with a sign on the front door.FOX5A McDonald’s location has begun enforcing a new age policy to enter the restaurant[/caption]TikTok / saniabbyThe McDonald’s is now requiring ID to enter and barring those under 20 from entering without a parent[/caption]TikTok / saniabbyThe McDonald’s location is enforcing the new policy with security guards and NYPD[/caption]A McDonald’s location in Brooklyn, at Nostrand and Flatbush avenues, has begun carding diners at the door and enforcing restrictions on who can enter.“No one under the age of 20 is allowed in this restaurant without a parent and proper identification,” reads the sign posted on the front door, seen in a TikTok video posted earlier this month.McDonald’s customer Sania Bolasingh (@saniabby), who grew up in Flatbush, saw firsthand the new policy at the New York City location, enforced by security guards and NYPD officers.The TikToker showed the inside of the McDonald’s restaurant, pointing out how calm it was.“Do you see how peaceful this McDonald’s is? You see how there’s no kids, no turmoil, nobody fighting?” she said.Sania then approached the security guard standing just inside the restaurant’s doors enforcing the age restrictions, joking with him about the new policy.“They’ve got the kids waiting outside,” said the customer, panning to show two teens standing right outside the McDonald’s. “It’s crazy.”BIG MAC ATTACKThe Brooklyn location implemented the new ID rule after a violent attack by a group of teenagers after school, McDonald’s manager Amber Hussain told the New York Post. The kids wearing ski masks broke a glass door and attacked a security guard, with the manager describing it as a “crazy scene.“Hussain, 19, shared that every day after school for the past year she has worked at the location, up to 20 teenagers “trash the store,” and throw ice at diners, steal food deliveries from Uber Eats workers, and smoke weed inside the restaurant. Considering that the McDonald’s is infamous in the neighborhood, the new ID rule came as no surprise to locals.“If you’re from that area, you know that McDonald’s is horrible,” Sania told the New York Post.“People fight in there – it’s not just kids being kids. People get stabbed, a delivery worker got jumped, he passed out.”If you’re from that area, you know that McDonald’s is horrible. People fight in there – it’s not just kids being kids. People get stabbed, a delivery worker got jumped, he passed out.”Sania BolasinghFlatbush ResidentThe McDonald’s, located in an area dubbed “the junction,” has been the location of many shootings and stabbings over the years. Over 100 calls to 911 each year were made inside and in front of the restaurant over the past three years, according to NYPD data.There have already been 29 calls to 911 from the McDonald’s this year.While some locals have admitted they are frustrated by the new restrictions and argue that teenagers need spots to hang out at after class, others were in favor of the rule due to public safety concerns. Crime in the area similarly drove a dozen Giant grocery stores to bar anyone under 18 from entering after 6 pm without an adult.As McDonald’s enforces its new age rule, the fast food giant is also offering new deals and menu items to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its Egg McMuffin.Meanwhile, customers have spotted a secret transition from the chain’s iconic yellow to a “new color scheme” as they fume the design has no personality.GettyThe new McDonald’s ID requirement is similar to the Costco policy that requires customers to prove their membership status before entering[/caption]",

      "content": "In This Article: Bank of America ( BAC ) and BlackRock ( BLK ) are scrapping mentions of \"diversity\" from their annual reports as scrutiny of DEI policies intensifies across Wall Street. Bank of America removed all eight references to \"diversity and inclusion\" in its 2024 report filed Tuesday, when compared with its 2023 filing. In a number of places where the nation’s second largest bank removed “diversity” it replaced the word with “opportunity,” including renaming its diversity and inclusion group within its human resources department as the opportunity and inclusion group. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, also removed four references to \"diversity\" in its new annual report filed Tuesday, including replacing a section titled, \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" with one called \"connectivity and inclusivity.\" In that new section, the company stated that \"delivering for the firm’s clients” requires “creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.” The annual report revisions come as some of the biggest companies on Wall Street are increasingly targets of conservative activists seeking changes to DEI policies across corporate America. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) has also dropped almost all mentions of \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" from its annual report , and Goldman Sachs (GS) dropped a pledge to avoid taking a company public if that company had an all white male board. At Citigroup ( C ), CEO Jane Fraser announced last week in a memo to company employees that the New York banking giant would no longer require new hires to be selected from a diverse set of job applicants. She also said that an existing \"diversity, equity and inclusion and talent management” team would now be known as \"talent management and engagement.\" \"It is important to note that we’re living in an environment where things are changing quickly,\" Fraser said. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan was asked Tuesday at an event in Washington, D.C., whether his company had a DEI policy in place or not. \"We have diversity and inclusion at our company,” Moynihan said at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. “But, step back: we’ve always been the bank of opportunity,\" Moynihan added. A Bank of America spokesman later said in a statement to Yahoo Finance that “we are deliberate about the many ways we seek to create an inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to achieve their career goals.” \"This is core to our values, to our efforts to make the Corporation a great place to work and to delivering on Responsible Growth for our clients, customers and communities around the globe,\" the spokesman added.",

      "description": "Tariffs Will Continue Until Morale Improves Via The Variant Perception blog,The relative strength of the US economy makes tariff threats an effective negotiating tool, and “America First” trade and security priorities mean tariffs will remain a feature of Trump's second term. Allocations to volatility and TIPS should prove the best hedges for headline risk and the stagflationary impulse from implemented tariffs.As tariff announcements start to dominate headlines, we provide three key points to serve as anchors:Weak rest of world (i.e., non US) growth means less bargaining power for targeted countriesDemand is the US's key “export” and the ultimate currencyTariffs are here to stay as MAGA 2.0 embraces Reagan + RooseveltWeak rest of world (i.e., non US) growth means less bargaining power for targeted countriesAt inauguration, we noted the slim Republican House majority could make tariffs a higher priority (relative to tax cuts) in Trump's second administration than his first. One key difference between today and 2018 is the global growth backdrop, raising the likelihood of quicker resolutions to tariff threats in order to avoid a significant growth downturn in targeted countries.On the growth front, the US economy is much stronger relative to the Euro Area and China than at the onset of the first trade war in 2018 (which was preceded by a period of “globally synchronized growth”).This raises the stakes for non US countries, whose economies would come under further pressure from a protracted trade war (see shaded area above). It's possible these growth imbalances encourage targeted countries to settle tariff disputes quickly (as seen today with delayed tariffs on Mexico).Demand is the US's key “export” and the ultimate currencyOn top of the favorable cyclical backdrop, the US's role as the chief source of global external demand gives it more bargaining power in trade negotiations.The US trade deficit has persisted for the past 25 years and represents the US's role as the “shock absorber” for global excess production. In other words, one can consider consumption demand to be the key export of the US to the rest of the world. So, any like for like retaliation will hurt non US countries more given the US (as the chief buyer) can turn to other sellers more easily than a seller can find a buyer that can replace the US.Related to this, the US is also a closed economy relative to most other economies. So, any broad based decline in trade will weigh less on the US economy than other more trade dependent economies.Tariffs are here to stay as MAGA 2.0 embraces Reagan + RooseveltThe asymmetric leverage leaves the Trump administration free to pursue its MAGA/\"America First\" strategy of restructuring trade and security and make it likely that tariffs will be a regular feature of this administration, not only a negotiating tool.The use of tariffs to implement the “America First” strategy appears to be a consensus among key members of Trump's administration, notably Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (who recently advocated for gradual implementation of US tariffs up to 20%) and chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran (who outlined a similar plan in “A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System”).The trade policy echoes Reagan's administration, which used measures like “Voluntary Export Controls” to limit imports of foreign goods and incentivize foreign companies to invest in the US. We think Trump will use tariffs consistently to boost investment in the US, given he's repeatedly stated that the best way to avoid tariffs is to build in the USA.Meanwhile, the security policy echoes the Roosevelt Corollary, which extended the Monroe Doctrine to allow for more direct US intervention in the broader Americas. The threat of tariffs to force Colombia to accept repatriated citizens, Panama to not renew its key canal deal with China, and Mexico to bolster border security are all evidence of a modern Monroe Doctrine/Roosevelt Corollary in action.S&P and Treasury yields are the best KPIs, long TIPS + vol the best hedgesWhile Trump has stated he is not concerned about the market reaction, we still think a meaningful equity market drawdown or economic slowdown are the key constraints to Trump's use of tariffs. After all, the only major pause in tariff announcements in Trump's first term was during the S&P 500's 15% pullback at the end of 2018. Treasury yields breaching 5% on inflation fears could also prove a constraint on Trump's tariff agenda.Taken together, we think long exposure to TIPS and volatility will be the best hedges against tariff headline risk and the stagflationary effect of tariffs (once they are implemented).

On top of the favorable cyclical backdrop, the US's role as the chief source of global external demand gives it more bargaining power in trade negotiations . The US trade deficit has persisted for the past 25 years and represents the US's role as the “shock absorber” for global excess production. In other words, one can consider consumption demand to be the key export of the US to the rest of the world. So, any like for like retaliation will hurt non US countries more given the US (as the chief buyer) can turn to other sellers more easily than a seller can find a buyer that can replace the US. Related to this, the US is also a closed economy relative to most other economies . So, any broad based decline in trade will weigh less on the US economy than other more trade dependent economies. The asymmetric leverage leaves the Trump administration free to pursue its MAGA/\"America First\" strategy of restructuring trade and security and make it likely that tariffs will be a regular feature of this administration , not only a negotiating tool. The use of tariffs to implement the “America First” strategy appears to be a consensus among key members of Trump's administration , notably Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (who recently advocated for gradual implementation of US tariffs up to 20% ) and chair of the Council of Economic Advisors Stephen Miran (who outlined a similar plan in “ A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System ”). The trade policy echoes Reagan's administration , which used measures like “Voluntary Export Controls” to limit imports of foreign goods and incentivize foreign companies to invest in the US. We think Trump will use tariffs consistently to boost investment in the US, given he's repeatedly stated that the best way to avoid tariffs is to build in the USA. Meanwhile, the security policy echoes the Roosevelt Corollary , which extended the Monroe Doctrine to allow for more direct US intervention in the broader Americas. The threat of tariffs to force Colombia to accept repatriated citizens, Panama to not renew its key canal deal with China, and Mexico to bolster border security are all evidence of a modern Monroe Doctrine/Roosevelt Corollary in action. While Trump has stated he is not concerned about the market reaction, we still think a meaningful equity market drawdown or economic slowdown are the key constraints to Trump's use of tariffs . After all, the only major pause in tariff announcements in Trump's first term was during the S&P 500's 15% pullback at the end of 2018. Treasury yields breaching 5% on inflation fears could also prove a constraint on Trump's tariff agenda. Taken together, we think long exposure to TIPS and volatility will be the best hedges against tariff headline risk and the stagflationary effect of tariffs (once they are implemented).",

      "content": "Robinhood Markets Inc HOOD CEO Vlad Tenev is optimistic about the company’s future and the broader cryptocurrency landscape, highlighting the firm’s strong performance and the changing regulatory environment under the Trump administration . What Happened: In a Bloomberg TV interview on Tuesday, Tenev emphasized Robinhood’s recent success, noting the company’s first billion dollar revenue quarter and record net income profits . “The business has been doing tremendously well,” he said, citing record net deposits of $50 billion into the platform in 2024. Despite recent market volatility, Tenev maintained a long term perspective, advising against focusing on day to day market fluctuations. Regarding the current market downturn , Tenev observed that Robinhood’s customers tend to view such moments as buying opportunities, particularly for high quality companies and assets. “Our customers, which might surprise some people, have a long term perspective on these things. They’d like to be owners of technology and innovation,” he noted. Tenev also discussed the company’s new active trader platform, Robinhood Legend, which has already reached a $50 million annual revenue run rate. He pointed out that active traders have strategies to deploy regardless of market conditions, making this business segment more sustainable even during downturns. On the regulatory front, Tenev welcomed the SEC’s decision to close its investigation into Robinhood’s crypto operations without pursuing enforcement action. He sees a role for financial regulators. “I think customers want to know that their assets are safe and that someone is watching over the companies that are providing financial services to them and holding them accountable.” Read Also: Bitcoin Languishes Below $88,000 As Spot ETFs See $1 Billion Outflows On Tuesday What’s Next: Looking ahead, Tenev expressed excitement about the potential for tokenization and expanded access to private company stocks. He argued for rethinking accreditation rules and allowing the connection of crypto technology with real companies. “We need to, aside from the accreditation, allow for the capability of connecting crypto technology with real companies.” In a separate interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Tenev praised the current administration’s approach to financial services and cryptocurrency, saying, “We’re fortunate to have an administration that wants the U.S. to be number one in AI and financial services and crypto.” This marks a significant shift from what he described as an “all out assault” on retail trading and crypto under the previous administration.

      "content": "Shares of DigitalOcean Holdings Inc DOCN were climbing in early trading on Wednesday after the company reported upbeat fourth quarter results . Here are some key analyst takeaways. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Thomas Blakey maintained a Neutral rating, while raising the price target from $39 to $43. JPMorgan analyst Pinjalim Bora reiterated a Neutral rating, while raising the price target from $40 to $45. JMP Securities analyst Patrick Walravens maintained a Market Outperform rating and price target of $55. Check out other analyst stock ratings . Cantor Fitzgerald : DigitalOcean delivered a solid quarter, with the NDRR (net dollar retention rate) rising to 99%, Blakey said. The sequential improvement was driven by \"large, high spend customers and new product uptake with over 50% of top 100 customers adopting at least one new feature released in 3Q24,\" he added. The company's adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 42%. They surpassed the guidance range of 34% 38% by managing spend and resource allocation when while ramping new products and increased hiring, the analyst stated. \"Our optimism is somewhat offset by the downtick in adjusted EBITDA margins in C25, deceleration in small customer count declines, and continued slowdown in lower spend customer revenue cohort,\" he further wrote. JPMorgan : DigitalOcean reported all metrics above consensus, with acceleration in both total revenues and annual recurring revenues (ARR), Bora said. The net dollar retention rate rose by 200 basis points from the previous quarter, with \"strong momentum of its customer cohort that spends $100K/year, in addition to a stable churn rate,\" he added. Although DigitalOcean provided its 2025 revenue growth guidance broadly in line with expectations, its projection for adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.5% at the midpoint came in 130 basis points below consensus, the analyst stated. Revenue growth is likely to be driven by \"revenue from new customers, with expansion within existing customers contributing a neutral to slightly positive impact,\" he further wrote. JMP Securities : DigitalOcean reported strong quarterly results, with non GAAP earnings of 49 cents per share, beating consensus of 34 cents per share, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, above consensus of 36%, Walravens said. The company guided to first quarter non GAAP earnings of 41 cents to 46 cents per share on adjusted EBITDA margin of 38% to 40%, he added. DigitalOcean has been enhancing its AI infrastructure offerings, including its new AI platform, which allows users to “create their own AI agents” and its partnership with open source AI/ML platform Hugging Face, the analyst stated. \"DigitalOcean did not break out the ARR contribution from its AI/ML platform,\" he further wrote. Price Action: Shares of DigitalOcean had risen by 7.36% to $43.77 at the time of publication on Wednesday.

In February 2022, Crocs completed its acquisition of HEYDUDE, a footwear brand focusing on casual, comfortable, and lightweight footwear. As is relevant here, the Company reports HEYDUDE sales in two segments: direct to consumer (\"DTC\") sales; and wholesale sales (which include sales to major retailers). Even though HEYDUDE was only acquired by Crocs in mid February 2022, HEYDUDE accounted for approximately 25% of the Company's total revenues in 2022. Investors began to learn the truth about the nature and unsustainability of HEYDUDE's revenue growth on April 27, 2023, when Defendant Rees revealed during the Company's first quarter 2023 earnings call that much of HEYDUDE's revenue growth in 2022 was attributable to efforts to stock the Company's wholesale partners with HEYDUDE products and was not necessarily indicative of actual downstream retail sales. On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $23.46 per share, or nearly 16%, from a close of $147.78 per share on April 26, 2023, to close at $124.32 per share on April 27, 2023. On July 27, 2023, Defendant Rees admitted that Crocs's deliberate overstocking accounted for approximately $220 million of HEYDUDE's $896 million in revenue for the period following the closing of the acquisition on February 17, 2022. Defendant Anne Mehlman, the Company's Chief Financial Officer at the time, also announced that Crocs was reducing HEYDUDE's revenue growth guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2023, to a range between 14% and 18%—substantially lower than previous guidance revenue growth in the mid 20s—effectively acknowledging that much of HEYDUDE's purported growth was based upon Defendants' decision to overstock wholesalers. On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $17.50 per share, or nearly 15%, from a close of $119.80 per share on July 26, 2023, to close at $102.30 per share on July 27, 2023. On November 2, 2023, Crocs announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023, and revealed that HEYDUDE's \"[w]holesale revenues declined 19.4% to $146.5 million following prior year pipeline fill and as our wholesale partners were more cautious on at once orders.\" As a result of the prior overstocking of HEYDUDE's products, Crocs further slashed its 2023 HEYDUDE revenue growth guidance from between 14% and 18%, to between only 4% and 6% (even though HEYDUDE DTC sales continued to grow 14.6% during the quarter). In connection with this announcement, Defendant Rees admitted that HEYDUDE \"inventory was too high\" and that the Company \"is proactively lowering in channel inventories\" and \"working with our strategic accounts to clean up that inventory and putting them in a strong sell through and a more profitable position.\" On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $4.62 per share, or more than 5%, from a close of $87.41 per share on November 1, 2023, to close at $82.79 per share on November 2, 2023. Then, on October 29, 2024, investors learned more about HEYDUDE's prospects when the Company reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the accompanying earnings call, Defendant Rees disclosed that HEYDUDE revenues fell below the Company's expectations and revealed that \"HEYDUDE's recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the business to turn the corner.\" Rees attributed HEYDUDE's struggles to \"excess inventories in the market\" and admitted that \"we've made good progress, but frankly, not quite all the progress we want to make\" in resolving the inventory issue. Moreover, Rees admitted that \"if you think about this sort of [20]22 into [20]23 timeframe, in retrospect, we absolutely shipped too much product[],\" calling that decision \"wrong\" and highlighting that a lack of product demand exacerbated the issue. On this news, the price of Crocs common stock declined $26.47 per share, or approximately 19.2%, from a close of $138.05 per share on October 28, 2024, to close at $111.58 per share on October 29, 2024. The court appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Crocs' conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

However, over the past month, the stock fell by 14.34% , and in the past year, by 29.13% . Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. Evaluating EPAM Sys P/E in Comparison to Its Peers The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. EPAM Sys has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 118.55 of the IT Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price to earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions. © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Europe's Defense Stocks See a Boom 🇺🇸🤔 US defense stocks are falling. Over the month: • Lockheed Martin:  16.41% • Northrop Grumman:  13% • General Dynamics:  10.93% • Raytheon Technologies:  2.66% European defense stocks are rising: 🇩🇪 Rheinmetall: +36.4% 🇫🇷 Thales: +22.66% 🇬🇧 BAE Systems: +10.17% 🇪🇺... Trending: Many don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move While U.S. companies struggle, European defense stocks are soaring. Investors are betting on increased military budgets across Europe as the region faces pressure to boost its own defense spending. Rheinmetall saw a surge of 21.89% in the last 30 days and Thales climbed 19.23%. Others, like BAE Systems and Airbus, saw an increase but later stabilized. European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer , have been vocal about the need for higher defense spending. Additionally, French President Emmanuel Macron was hosting an emergency summit on the Ukraine war, where military budgets were a major topic after Trump surprised European allies in NATO and Ukraine by revealing he had spoken with Putin without prior consultation and planned to initiate a peace process.

Wall Street Vs. European Markets The impact of Trump's presidency on global markets is already showing. Since his inauguration, European stocks have outperformed U.S. markets. As the Financial Times reported, the Stoxx Europe 600 has gained 5.2% compared to the S&P 500's 2.5% increase. This rally happened because the U.S. hasn't placed new tariffs on European goods, there's hope for peace talks in Ukraine, and the European Central Bank has made borrowing easier by lowering interest rates. However, the outlook remains uncertain, as Trump has announced new tariffs on European cars, pharmaceuticals, and chips, which briefly sent European stocks lower. The Big Picture Trump's unpredictable stance on military spending is sending mixed signals to investors. While he advocates for cost cutting, he also emphasizes U.S. military strength, having signed an order to explore an “Iron Dome of America” missile defense system. For now, European defense stocks are riding high, while U.S. companies brace for potential cuts.

      "description": "The Investing Club holds its \"Morning Meeting\" every weekday at 10:20 a.m. ET.",
      "content": "Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a \"Morning Meeting\" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. The broader market rebounded Wednesday, with the S & P 500 and Nasdaq trying to snap their four day losing streaks. The Dow was on pace for its third straight winning session. Defensive sectors like consumer staples and health care were laggards as consumers expressed less optimism about the U.S. economy. On the consumer discretionary side, Club stock TJX Companies jumped more than 3% after the off price retailer delivered a strong quarter and what was viewed as conservative guidance. Jim Cramer called TJX the \"ultimate value stock.\" Club members should watch their texts and emails on Wednesday afternoon for our TJX earnings analysis 2. The main event on Wednesday is Nvidia , which reports earnings after the stock market closes. Shares of the AI chip leader jumped more than 4.5% ahead of the release, which would break a pretty rough three session losing streak. The Club name's quarterly results and guidance could determine the trajectory of the market Thursday and beyond. Jim wants to hear that DeepSeek's AI model claims won't hurt business. Salesforce , another Club holding, delivers earnings Wednesday evening as well. Jim will be looking for updates on how Agentforce is selling. Salesforce shares rose 1.5% ahead of the numbers. As of Tuesday's close, the stock dropped five sessions in a row. 3. Eli Lilly caught a positive catalyst call from JPMorgan ahead of its Phase 3 readouts for its oral GLP 1 type 2 diabetes drug in the second quarter and obesity in the third quarter. The analysts see a favorable risk reward into these events with shares up 10% in their base case against a low probability downside. Eli Lilly Wednesday announced plans to invest at least $27 billion to build four new manufacturing plants in the U.S. That brings the company's total expansion commitment to more than $50 billion since 2020. \"The other companies just don't have the firepower to do that,\" Jim explained. Shares of Eli Lilly got a 1% bump on the news, bucking modest weakness in the health care sector. 4. Stocks covered in Wednesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Lowe's , Cava , Sempra , and General Motors . (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long TJX, NVDA, CRM, LLY.

      "content": "Amsterdam, 26 February 2025 EXOR ANNOUNCES THE LAUNCH OF AN ACCELERATED BOOKBUILD OFFERING FOR APPROXIMATELY 4% OF FERRARI’S OUTSTANDING SHARES Exor remains fully committed to supporting Ferrari’s strategy as well as remaining its largest shareholder for the long term No changes in Ferrari’s governance structure following the transaction The transaction will reduce concentration within Exor’s portfolio. Sale proceeds of approximately €3 billion are intended to be used to pursue diversification through a sizeable new acquisition and to launch a new share buyback program for €1 billion Exor N.V. (“Exor”) announces that it intends to sell approximately 7 million of the common shares it holds in Ferrari N.V. (“Ferrari”) (representing approximately 4% of the outstanding common shares of Ferrari) by way of an accelerated bookbuild offering to institutional investors (the “Offering”). This transaction will reduce concentration within Exor’s portfolio and allow for a sizeable new acquisition, when such an opportunity present itself, as Exor continues to pursue its purpose of building great companies. In addition, Exor intends to use a portion of the proceeds from this transaction to launch a new share buyback program for €1 billion. Exor remains fully committed as a long term shareholder of Ferrari. Exor currently holds 24.9% of Ferrari’s economic rights and 36.7% of the voting rights in the share capital of Ferrari 1 . Post completion of the announced transaction, Exor will remain Ferrari’s single largest shareholder with approximately 20% of the economic rights and 30% of the voting rights in Ferrari’s share capital. Moreover, in the context of the transaction, Exor has agreed to enter into a 360 day lock up commitment, with respect to its remaining common shares of Ferrari. All the governance arrangements with respect to the shareholding in Ferrari will remain unchanged following the transaction, including the shareholders’ agreement between Exor and Piero Ferrari and Trust Piero Ferrari, who together will continue to have a voting interest in Ferrari close to 50%. John Elkann, Chief Executive Officer of Exor, said: “Over the last decade, Ferrari’s performance has been a major driver behind Exor’s tripling its NAV, and its success has taken its share in our portfolio from approximately 15% to approximately 50% of NAV. The transaction will allow us to reduce our concentration and improve diversification by making a sizeable new acquisition, consistent with our purpose of building great companies. Our support to Ferrari and our trust in its solid future is unwavering. Our commitment to remain its largest shareholder for the long term is stronger than ever.” The bookbuilding period will commence immediately following this announcement and may close at any time on short notice. The completion of the bookbuilding process and the results of the Offering will be announced as soon as practicable thereafter. The Offering is expected to settle on 3 March 2025. Goldman Sachs Bank Europe and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners (the \"Joint Global Coordinators\") for the Offering. About Exor Exor N.V. (AEX: EXO) has been building great companies since its foundation by the Agnelli Family. For more than a century, Exor has made successful investments worldwide, applying a culture that combines entrepreneurial spirit and financial discipline.

Cette évolution provient de la croissance de l’activité sur l’exercice, de l’impact positif du mix produit sur la marge brute et de la solide maîtrise des coûts. Le taux de marge opérationnelle s’élève à 2,3%. Evolution par canal de distribution 10 En 2024, les ventes en magasins affichent une solide dynamique, avec près de 72 millions de passages en caisse (+1,5% par rapport à 2023). Les ventes en ligne renouent avec la croissance (+2,2% vs 2023) et représentent 22% des ventes totales du Groupe, notamment portées par l’attractivité des reverse marketplaces déployées avec nos partenaires. Les ventes omnicanales sont en progression de +1,7 point et représentent désormais 52% des ventes en ligne du Groupe. Ces résultats viennent confirmer, une nouvelle fois, la pertinence de la stratégie omnicanale adoptée par Fnac Darty. Evolution par catégorie de produits 1 Les produits techniques sont en légère progression après plusieurs années de baisse. Les ordinateurs et la téléphonie bénéficient des prémices du cycle de rééquipement ainsi que du déploiement d’innovations. Les tablettes et les casques poursuivent leur trajectoire de croissance. Les services continuent leur progression dans toutes les régions. La diversification affiche également une solide performance grâce à la croissance à deux chiffres du jeu jouet et de la papeterie. Les produits éditoriaux sont en recul, impactés, comme anticipé, par une base de comparaison élevée pour le gaming qui avait bénéficié d’un line up très dense en 2023. La performance du livre reste solide, portée principalement par l’attrait de nouvelles tendances de lecture. Enfin, l’ électroménager est en croissance, porté par une excellente dynamique du petit électroménager tandis que les ventes de gros électroménager restent en retrait, subissant toujours le point bas du cycle immobilier. Evolution par zone géographique 1 La zone France et Suisse affiche, en 2024, une stabilité de son chiffre d’affaires à données comparables 11 . En France, le Groupe surperforme le marché en 2024 de près de 2 points au regard des chiffres publiés par la Banque de France 12 . Nature & Découvertes affiche un fort recul de ses ventes et de sa rentabilité par rapport à l’an dernier, résultant de la baisse de la consommation discrétionnaire en France et d’une très forte concurrence d’acteurs low cost . Depuis le début de l’année, une nouvelle gouvernance a été mise en place et une nouvelle feuille de route sera intégrée dans le nouveau plan stratégique qui sera présenté en juin 2025. Le résultat opérationnel courant s’est élevé à 160 millions d’euros pour l’exercice 2024, contre 152,4 millions d’euros pour l’exercice 2023. Le taux de rentabilité opérationnelle courante s’établit à 2,5%. En Péninsule Ibérique , le chiffre d’affaires est en progression de +12,0% en données publiées et de +2,8 % à données comparables 2 . Le Portugal et l’Espagne affichent tous les deux une croissance de leurs ventes grâce notamment à une amélioration des indicateurs macro économiques. Le résultat opérationnel courant s’est élevé à 16,3 millions d’euros pour l’exercice 2024 contre 12,3 millions d’euros pour l’exercice 2023. Le taux de rentabilité opérationnelle courante atteint 2,0%. La zone Belgique et Luxembourg enregistre en 2024 un recul de ses ventes de  1,3% à données publiées et de  0,9% en données comparables 13 liée principalement à une forte intensité concurrentielle. Le résultat opérationnel courant du segment Belgique et Luxembourg s’établit à 5,4 millions d’euros en 2024, contre 6,0 millions d’euros pour l’exercice 2023. Le taux de rentabilité opérationnelle courante s’établit à 0,9%. Autres éléments du compte de résultat 14 Les éléments non courants s’établissent à  31 millions d’euros en 2024 contre  131 millions d’euros en 2023. Ce montant inclut notamment :  39 millions d’euros de complément à l’amende due dans le cadre du litige ADLC 15 et de charge d’ impairment de goodwill sur l’activité de la Belgique ;  17 millions d’euros de charges d'impairment de divers projets informatiques  22 millions d’euros de charges de restructuration principalement liées à la gestion du parc immobilier ; +61 millions d’euros de résultat positif liés à la perte de contrôle de l’activité Billetterie ; d’autres éléments composés des coûts d’acquisition d’Unieuro et de charges de restructuration liées à l’adaptation du périmètre. Le résultat financier atteint  85 millions d’euros en 2024 contre  79 millions d’euros en 2023. La hausse de 6 millions d’euros s’explique notamment par une progression du coût de l’endettement financier net (11 millions d’euros) et par l’augmentation des charges IFRS 16 (14 millions d’euros) conséquences de la hausse des taux d’intérêt. En 2023, la cession des parts Daphni Purple avaient généré une moins value de l’ordre de 11 millions d’euros. La charge d’impôt s’élève à  29 millions d’euros stable par rapport à 2023. Le taux effectif d’impôt s’élève à 42,5%. Retraité des 39 millions d’euros d’éléments non courants exceptionnels décrits ci dessus, le résultat net part du Groupe des activités poursuivies   ajusté 16 s’élève à 71 millions d’euros en 2024. Structure financière Le cash flow libre opérationnel 2 hors IFRS 16 s’établit à 195 millions d’euros, en amélioration par rapport à fin 2023. Cette évolution reflète la maîtrise rigoureuse du BFR et des CAPEX du Groupe. Sur la période 2021 2024, le Groupe a généré un cash flow libre opérationnel hors IFRS 16 cumulé de 515 millions d’euros, dépassant l’objectif de 500 millions d’euros cumulés sur la période 2021 2024 annoncé dans le plan stratégique Everyday en 2021. L’ endettement brut du Groupe s’élève à 838 millions d’euros et est principalement composé : d’une émission obligataire convertible (OCEANE) de 200 millions d’euros à échéance 2027 ; et d’une émission obligataire de 550 millions d’euros à échéance mars 2029 ; Après prise en compte de la trésorerie disponible (1,1 milliard d’euros), le Groupe affiche une position nette de trésorerie de 224 millions d’euros au 31 décembre 2024. Par ailleurs, le Groupe dispose d’une ligne de crédit RCF de 500 millions d’euros et d’un delayed drawn term loan (DDTL) de 100 millions d’euros, non tirés à fin 2024 et dont la maturité a été allongée à mars 2028 (avec deux options d’extension confirmées à mars 2029 et mars 2030). Grâce à cette solide position de liquidité, le Groupe est confiant dans sa capacité à arbitrer de manière opportuniste l’allocation stratégique de ses moyens (M&A, désendettement, retour à l’actionnaire, etc.) tout en restant attentif à son niveau de ratio de levier. Fnac Darty respecte au 31 décembre 2024 la totalité de ses engagements contractuels au titre de ses crédits obligataires et corporate. Enfin, le Groupe est noté par les agences de notation Standard & Poor’s, Scope Ratings et Fitch Ratings qui ont attribué respectivement, au cours de l’année 2024, les notations BB+, BBB et BB+ assorties de perspectives négatives (S&P) ou stables (Fitch et Scope). INITIATIVES STRATÉGIQUES La croissance des résultats annuels 2024 démontre encore une fois la puissance et la singularité du modèle omnicanal du Groupe avec pour ambition d’ être, au quotidien et dans la durée, l’allié du consommateur pour l’accompagner dans une consommation durable et dans les usages quotidiens de son foyer . La transformation de Fnac Darty autour de services à haute valeur ajoutée, générant des cash flows récurrents se poursuit. À aujourd’hui, 1,4 million de clients ont placé leur confiance dans nos services d’abonnement emblématiques Darty Max et Vanden Borre Life . Le Groupe poursuit également sa stratégie de diversification , avec des initiatives variées qui contribuent à la progression des résultats du Groupe. Retailink, la régie publicitaire du Groupe, omnicanale et 100 % intégrée, imagine et déploie des offres et des dispositifs innovants permettant aux marques d’atteindre leurs objectifs de notoriété, d’engagement et de vente en se rapprochant de leurs communautés. Elle propose une offre de supports de visibilité parmi les plus complètes du marché. Avec plus de 1 500 écrans digitaux positionnés stratégiquement dans les points de vente, l'offre DOOH ( Display Out Of Home ) permet un ciblage fin en fonction du contexte de diffusion. Sur le web, les formats publicitaires nativement intégrés aux parcours d’achat en ligne touchent chaque mois plus de 22 millions d’internautes et prouvent aussi leur efficacité en magasin grâce à la mesure de l’effet ROPO ( Research Online Purchase Offline) . À fin 2024, l’activité Retailink réalise près de 100 millions d’euros de chiffre d’affaires et continue sa très forte progression avec une croissance à deux chiffres depuis 2019. Weavenn , la filiale dédiée à la logistique e commerce et au SaaS marketplace du Groupe a été lancée à l’été 2024 en partenariat avec Ceva Logistics. Le développement des activités est conforme aux anticipations. L’ambition à horizon cinq ans de réaliser un chiffre d’affaires de plus de 200 millions d’euros avec une marge opérationnelle à deux chiffres est confirmé. L’activité 2 nde Vie affiche, pour la seconde année consécutive, une croissance à deux chiffres et un volume d’affaire de près de 150 millions d’euros. Dans le cadre du développement du marché de la seconde main, et toujours avec l’idée d’accompagner les consommateurs vers une consommation plus durable et responsable, Fnac Darty a lancé en 2024 le passeport digital des produits électroménagers. Ce nouvel outil permettra de retracer avec fiabilité le cycle de vie de l’appareil, depuis sa fabrication jusqu’à son recyclage. Une première version de ce passeport est déjà disponible sur les « 2 nde vie collectors » , 4 000 produits issus du reconditionnement des appareils fournis par Darty au village des athlètes de Paris 2024, en tant que Supporteur Officiel. Par ailleurs, le Groupe propose des guides d'achat écoresponsables (publication de la 7 ème édition du Baromètre SAV) et des services de réparation pour prolonger la durée de vie des produits (2,6 millions de produits réparés par le Groupe en 2024). La réduction de l'empreinte carbone est également au cœur des préoccupations de Fnac Darty, qui vise à diminuer ses émissions de CO 2 de 50% d'ici 2030 par rapport à 2019. Des actions concrètes sont déployées pour, entre autres, améliorer l'efficacité énergétique des magasins et des entrepôts (consommation d’électricité en baisse de 27% vs 2022) ou promouvoir les produits éco conçus avec un étiquetage « Le choix durable » en magasin et sur les sites marchands. Les engagements environnementaux, sociaux et de gouvernance de Fnac Darty sont ainsi valorisés par les différentes notations reçues, en progression constante depuis plusieurs années ( Moody’s Analytics VE : 65/100 en progression de 4 points par rapport à 2022, Sustainanalytics : 11,8 vs. 12,8 en 2023, Ethifinance 80/100 vs 75/100). Par ailleurs, début 2025, Groupe a obtenu « A », la meilleure note au questionnaire CDP Climat , le plaçant ainsi parmi les meilleures entreprises au monde. ACQUISITION D’UNIEURO Le 16 juillet 2024, Fnac Darty a lancé une offre publique d’achat mixte sur Unieuro, leader italien des produits électroniques et de l’électroménager. Les différentes étapes de l’offre publique d’achat d’Unieuro se sont achevées le 30 décembre 2024. L’action Unieuro a été sortie de la cote de Milan le 8 janvier 2025. Le rapprochement entre Fnac Darty et Unieuro s’inscrit en cohérence avec le plan Everyday, les deux entités partageant des ambitions stratégiques communes centrées sur l’omnicanalité, le développement des services d’assistance du foyer par abonnement et l’orientation des clients vers des comportements plus durables et responsables. La combinaison de Fnac Darty et Unieuro donne naissance à un leader de la vente de produits électroniques, d’électroménager, de produits éditoriaux et de services en Europe de l’Ouest et du Sud avec plus de 10 milliards d’euros de chiffre d’affaires, 30 000 collaborateurs et plus de 1 500 magasins. PERIMÈTRE Le 2 décembre 2024, Fnac Darty et CTS Eventim ont annoncé avoir finalisé la cession de 17% de FranceBillet après avoir obtenu les autorisations nécessaires auprès des autorités de la concurrence. Fnac Darty conserve une participation de 35% et continue à participer à la gouvernance de la société, l’activité billetterie est mise en équivalence depuis le 1 er décembre 2024. L’impact de cette cession n’est pas significatif dans les résultats 2024 et représentera en 2025, une baisse d’environ 10 millions d’euros du résultat opérationnel courant. ADLC La décision de l’Autorité de la concurrence, rendue publique le 19 décembre 2024, a fixé le montant de l’amende dont Fnac Darty est redevable à l’issue de la procédure de transaction à 109 millions d’euros. Une provision de 85 millions d’euros ayant déjà été enregistrée dans les comptes du Groupe au deuxième trimestre 2023, une charge additionnelle de 24 millions d’euros est donc comptabilisée sur l’exercice 2024, sans impact sur le résultat opérationnel courant. Les financements à court terme du Groupe permettront d’assurer le règlement de la transaction qui devrait intervenir en 2025. GOUVERNANCE ET ACTIONNARIAT Au 31 décembre 2024, Vesa Equity Investment est l’actionnaire de référence du Groupe avec 28,28% du capital 17 , suivi de Ceconomy avec 21,95% du capital et GLAS SAS pour le compte d’ICG avec 10,22% du capital. Le 29 janvier 2025, Unieuro, qui fait désormais partie du groupe Fnac Darty, a nommé son nouveau Conseil d’administration, dont Enrique Martinez devient le Président. Maria Bruna Olivieri a également été nommée directrice générale Italie de Fnac Darty et rejoint ainsi le comité exécutif. Le Conseil d’administration de Fnac Darty proposera à l’assemblée générale le renouvellement de Monsieur Jacques Veyrat et de Mesdames Sandra Lagumina et Caroline Grégoire Sainte Marie, ainsi que la ratification de la cooptation de M. Stefano Meloni en tant d’administrateur, en remplacement de M. Nonce Paolini, décédé en juillet 2024. DIVIDENDE Fnac Darty proposera à l’Assemblée générale annuelle des actionnaires, prévue le 28 mai 2025, d’approuver la distribution d’un dividende de 1,00 euro par action, en hausse de 55 cents par rapport à 2023. Ce montant représente un taux de distribution de 40% calculé sur le résultat net part du Groupe des activités poursuivies   ajusté 18 , conforme aux années précédentes et à la politique de retour à l’actionnaire présentée dans le plan stratégique Everyday. La date de détachement du dividende est fixée au 2 juillet 2025 et la mise en paiement au 4 juillet 2025. PERSPECTIVES 2025 La présentation d’un nouveau plan stratégique interviendra en juin 2025 et permettra d’inclure Unieuro dans la mise à jour des objectifs moyen terme du Groupe. Le Groupe aborde 2025 avec confiance et anticipe une croissance « mid single digit » de son Résultat Opérationnel Courant (ROC) hors Unieuro, par rapport au ROC 2024 hors activités billetterie 19 . ********* PRÉSENTATION DES RÉSULTATS ANNUELS 2024 Enrique Martinez, Directeur Général et Jean Brieuc Le Tinier, Directeur Financier du Groupe, animeront une présentation virtuelle des résultats en français, avec traduction simultanée en anglais, le 26 février 2025 à 18h30 (heure continentale) ; 5:30 p.m. (UK) ; 12:30 p.m. (East Coast USA).

SUIVI DES INDICATEURS EXTRA FINANCIERS DU PLAN EVERYDAY DÉFINITIONS DES INDICATEURS ALTERNATIFS DE PERFORMANCE APPLICATION DE LA NORME IFRS 16 Le 13 janvier 2016, l’IASB a publié la norme IFRS 16 « Contrats de location ». La norme IFRS 16 remplace la norme IAS 17 et ses interprétations. Cette norme, entrée en vigueur pour les exercices ouverts à partir du 1er janvier 2019, impose la comptabilisation d’un actif (le droit d’utilisation) et d’un passif (dette de loyers) calculé sur la base des loyers inévitables actualisés. Le Groupe applique la norme IFRS 16 depuis le 1er janvier 2019. Afin d’assurer la transition entre la norme IAS 17 et la norme IFRS 16, l’ensemble des contrats de location et l’ensemble des contrats de prestation rentrant dans le champ d’application de la norme IFRS 16 ont été analysés. Pour le suivi de sa performance financière, le Groupe publie des indicateurs qui excluent l’application de la norme IFRS 16. Ces indicateurs sont l’EBITDA courant hors IFRS 16, le cash flow libre opérationnel hors IFRS 16, ainsi que l’endettement financier net hors IFRS 16. 1 Activité Fnac Darty 2024 hors Unieuro – objectifs tels que communiqués : Résultat Opérationnel Courant d’au moins 180 millions d’euros et Cash flow libre opérationnel cumulé 2021 2024 de 500 millions d’euros (hors IFRS 16) 2 Proposition soumise à l’approbation de l’Assemblée Générale du 28 mai 2025 3 Pro forma : non audité : données publiées Groupe (12 mois Fnac Darty + 1 mois Unieuro) + données 11 mois Unieuro (janvier à novembre 2024) 4 En année pleine à horizon 2026 5 Impact de la déconsolidation de l’activité Billetterie sur le ROC : environ 10 millions d’euros. 6 Activité Fnac Darty 2024 hors Unieuro 7 Non audité : données publiées Groupe (12 mois Fnac Darty + 1 mois Unieuro) + données 11 mois Unieuro (janvier à novembre 2024). 8 Données comparables   LFL : excluent les effets de change, les variations de périmètre, les ouvertures et fermetures de magasins. 9 Correspond au résultat net courant part du Groupe des activités poursuivies ajusté de la charge additionnelle relative à la transaction avec l’Autorité de la concurrence (24M€) et de charge d’ impairment de goodwill sur la Belgique (15M€). 10 Activité Fnac Darty 2024 hors Unieuro 11 Données comparables – LFL : excluent les effets de change, les variations de périmètre, les ouvertures et fermetures de magasins. 12 Données marché sur l’année 2024 publiées par Banque de France le 20 janvier 2025. 13 Données comparables – LFL : excluent les effets de change, les variations de périmètre, les ouvertures et fermetures de magasins. 14 Activité Fnac Darty 2024 hors Unieuro 15 La décision de l’Autorité de la concurrence, rendue publique le 19 décembre 2024, a fixé le montant de l’amende dont Fnac Darty est redevable à l’issue de la procédure de transaction à 109 millions d’euros.

We have succeeded in establishing a very special position in the retail market thanks to our successful transformation, a focus on sustainability, the turning point in innovation and the lead we have taken in AI. The omnichannel strategy and the diversification of our offering, putting services at the heart of our business model, contributed to our outperformance. It was a year marked by events and celebrations with significant potential to raise the visibility of our brands (the Olympic and Paralympic Games, 70 years of Fnac, 50 years of Darty’s “Contrat de confiance”). 2024 was also the year of the acquisition of Unieuro, the leader in specialized retail in Italy, which marks an acceleration in our development and strengthens our position as European leader. This external growth operation, the Group’s largest since its creation, offers promising prospects for growth, consolidation and synergies. In 2025, we will see the completion of our Everyday strategic plan and the launch of a new strategic cycle. I would like to thank all of our teams for these results and successes, and to welcome the Unieuro teams to the Group.” 2024 ANNUAL RESULTS – KEY FIGURES COMMENTS ON THE REPORTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The reported financial statements as of December 31, 2024 include 12 months of Fnac Darty activity and 1 month of Unieuro activity, consolidated since November 26, 2024. 2024 reported revenue was €8,253 million, up by +4.8% compared to 2023. Current operating income was €189 million, compared to €171 million in 2023. Unieuro’s contribution to the Group’s reported results represents €321 million in revenue and €7 million in current operating income. COMMENTS ON FNAC DARTY’S 2024 ACTIVITY 1 2024 revenue was €7,932 million, up by +0.7% compared to 2023 in reported data and by +0.2% on a like for like basis 3 . The gross margin rate reached 30.6% in 2024 (+50 bps compared to 2023 excluding the dilutive impact of the franchise and the integration of MediaMarkt). This sharp increase reflects the growing contribution of the Services businesses, which posted a solid performance during the year, and, to a lesser extent, a positive product mix effect related to the decline in gaming. Operating costs totaled €2,243 million in 2024, compared to €2,209 million in 2023. Adjusted for the impact of Weavenn’s launch and the integration of MediaMarkt stores in Portugal, these only increased by €13 million thanks to the performance plans, which continued to improve the productivity of each department. Current EBITDA amounted to €549 million, up +3% compared to 2023. This includes the application of IFRS 16 for €270 million. Current operating income was in line with the announced target of at least €180m, reaching €182 million at the end of December 2024, compared to €171 million in 2023. This improvement is due to business growth over the year, the positive impact of the product mix on gross margin and strong cost control. The operating margin rate was 2.3%. Changes by distribution channel 10 In 2024, in store sales posted solid momentum, with nearly 72 million checkout transactions (+1.5% compared to 2023). Online sales returned to growth (+2.2% compared to 2023), accounting for 22% of the Group’s total sales. This was driven in particular by the attractiveness of reverse marketplaces implemented with our partners. Omnichannel sales grew by +1.7 points, now accounting for 52% of the Group’s online sales. These results once again confirmed the relevance of the omnichannel strategy adopted by Fnac Darty. Changes by product category 1 Consumer electronics recorded a slight increase after several years of decline. Computers and telephony benefited from the beginnings of the re equipment cycle and the launch of innovations. Tablets and headphones continued on their upward trajectory. Services continued to grow in all regions. Diversification also posted strong performance thanks to double digit growth in toys and games as well as in stationery. Editorial products saw a decline, impacted, as expected, by a high basis of comparison for gaming, which had benefited from a very dense line up in 2023. Books continued to perform well, largely because of new reading trends. Lastly, domestic appliances posted growth, driven by excellent performance from small domestic appliances, while sales of large domestic appliances continued to flag, still affected by the slump in the real estate market. Changes by region 1 Revenue in France and Switzerland was stable in 2024 on a like for like basis 11 . In France, the Group outperformed the market by nearly 2 points in 2024 according to the figures published by the Banque de France 12 . As a result of the fall in consumer discretionary spending in France and strong competition from low cost players, Nature & Découvertes posted a sharp decline in sales and profitability compared to last year. Since the beginning of the year, a new governance structure has been put in place and a new roadmap will be incorporated into the new strategic plan to be unveiled in June 2025. Current operating income came to €160 million in 2024 compared to €152.4 million in 2023. Current operating margin was 2.5%. Revenue in the Iberian Peninsula increased by +12.0% in reported data and by +2.8% on a like for like basis 2 . Portugal and Spain both reported growth in sales, largely thanks to an improvement in macroeconomic indicators. Current operating income came to €16.3 million in 2024 compared to €12.3 million in 2023. Current operating margin was 2.0%. In 2024, Belgium and Luxembourg recorded a fall in sales of  1.3% in reported data and  0.9% on a like for like basis 13 , primarily due to intense competition. Current operating income for the Belgium and Luxembourg segment was €5.4 million in 2024, compared to €6.0 million in 2023. Current operating margin was 0.9%. Other income statement items 14 Non current items amounted to  €31 million in 2024 compared to  €131 million in 2023. This amount includes:  €39 million in exceptional expenses: an additional payment to the fine related to the French Competition Authority 15 of €24 million and the goodwill impairment of the Belgium business for €15 million;  €17 million in impairment on various IT projects;  €22 million in restructuring charges, mainly linked to the real estate portfolio management; +€61 million in positive income from the loss of control of the ticketing business; and other items comprising Unieuro acquisition costs and restructuring costs related to changes in scope. Net financial income amounted to  €85 million in 2024 compared to  €79 million in 2023. The increase of €6 million is mainly due to a rise in the cost of net financial debt (€11 million) and an increase in IFRS 16 expenses (€14 million) as a result of higher interest rates. In 2023, the disposal of Daphni Purple units generated a capital loss of around €11 million. Tax expenses were  €29 million, stable compared to 2023. The effective tax rate was 42.5%. Restated to take account of the €39 million in exceptional non current items described above, net income from continuing operations, Group share – adjusted 16 totaled €71 million in 2024. Financial structure Free cash flow from operations 2 excluding IFRS 16 was +€195 million, an improvement compared to the end of 2023. This change reflects strict control over the Group’s working capital requirement and Capex. Over the 2021–2024 period, the Group generated cumulative free cash flow from operations excluding IFRS 16 of €515 million, exceeding the cumulative target of €500 million over the 2021–2024 period announced in the strategic plan Everyday in 2021. The Group’s gross financial debt was €838 million, which mainly comprised: a €200 million convertible bond issue (OCEANE bond) maturing in 2027; and a €550 million bond issue maturing in March 2029. After taking available cash (€1.1 billion) into account, the Group’s net cash position stood at €224 million as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the Group has a revolving credit facility of €500 million and a delayed drawn term loan (DDTL) of €100 million, which was undrawn at the end of 2024. Its maturity date has been extended to March 2028 (with two further confirmed options to extend to March 2029 and March 2030). This strong liquidity position supports Group confidence to strategically allocate its resources in the most opportune way (M&A, debt reduction, shareholder return, etc.) while remaining attentive to its leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2024, Fnac Darty is fully compliant with its contractual commitments relating to its bonds and corporate loans. Finally, the Group is rated by the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Scope Ratings and Moody’s, which assigned ratings of BB+, BBB and BB+ respectively during 2024, with a negative outlook (S&P) or a stable outlook (Fitch and Scope). STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The growth of 2024 full year results once again demonstrates the power and singularity of the Group’s omnichannel model, with the ambition to be, on a daily basis and in the long term, the consumer’s ally in supporting sustainable consumption and the daily needs of their household. The transformation of Fnac Darty around high value added services continues, generating recurring cash flows. To date, 1.4 million customers have placed their trust in our flagship Darty Max and Vanden Borre Life subscription services . The Group is also continuing with its diversification strategy, with various initiatives that contribute to growth in the Group’s results. Retaillink , the Group’s fully integrated, omnichannel retail media agency, devises and deploys innovative offers and enhanced presence to help brands achieve their awareness, commitment and sales objectives by getting closer to their communities. Its range of visibility solutions is one of the most comprehensive on the market. With more than 1,500 digital screens strategically positioned at points of sale, the DOOH (Digital Out Of Home) offering allows granular targeting according to the advertising context. On the web, ad formats natively embedded in the online shopping process reach more than 22 million internet users each month. They are also proving to be effective in store, according to measurement of the ROPO (Research Online, Purchase Offline) effect. At the end of 2024, Retailink generated nearly €100 million in revenue and continued its robust growth with a double digit increase since 2019. Weavenn , the Group’s subsidiary specializing in e commerce logistics and the SaaS marketplace, was launched in the summer of 2024 in partnership with Ceva Logistics. The business is developing in line with expectations. It is still on track to meet its five year target of generating more than €200 million in revenue with a double digit operating margin. For the second year running, the Second Life business posted double digit growth and gross merchandise value of nearly €150 million. In connection with the development of the second hand market, and still with the aim of supporting consumers toward more sustainable and responsible consumption, Fnac Darty launched the digital passport for domestic appliances in 2024. This new tool will reliably trace the life cycle of an appliance, from manufacture to recycling. The first iteration of this passport is already available for “ Second Life Collectors ” items, which are 4,000 products from the reconditioning of appliances supplied to the Paris 2024 Olympic Village by Darty as a “Supporteur Officiel”. The Group also offers eco conscious purchasing guides (publication of the seventh edition of the After Sales Service Barometer) and repair services to extend product life span (with 2.6 million products repaired by the Group in 2024). A reduced carbon footprint is also a major concern for Fnac Darty, which aims to halve its CO 2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2019. Concrete actions are being implemented to improve the energy efficiency of stores and warehouses (electricity consumption down by 27% vs. 2022) or to promote eco designed products with the “Sustainable Choice” label in store and on e commerce sites. Fnac Darty’s environmental, social and governance commitments are reflected in the various ratings it has received, which have been steadily improving for several years ( Moody’s Analytics VE: 65/100, up 4 points from 2022; Sustainanalytics : 11.8 vs. 12.8 in 2023; Ethifinance 80/100 vs. 75/100). At the start of 2025, the Group also obtained an “A” – the highest score in the CDP Climate questionnaire – ranking it among the best companies in the world. UNIEURO ACQUISITION On July 16, 2024, Fnac Darty launched a mixed public tender offer for Unieuro, the leading Italian distributor of Consumer electronic products and Domestic appliances. The various stages of the Unieuro public tender offer were completed on December 30, 2024. Unieuro was delisted from the Milan Stock Exchange on January 8, 2025. The merger of Fnac Darty and Unieuro is in line with the Everyday strategic plan, with the two entities sharing common strategic ambitions focused on omnichannel, the development of home assistance services, and guiding customers towards more sustainable and responsible behaviours. The combination of Fnac Darty and Unieuro has created a leader in the sale of electronic products, domestic appliances, editorial products and services in Western and Southern Europe, with over €10 billion in revenue, 30,000 employees and over 1,500 stores. SCOPE On December 2, 2024, Fnac Darty and CTS Eventim announced that they had finalized the disposal of 17% of FranceBillet, after obtaining the necessary authorizations from the competition authorities. Fnac Darty retains a 35% stake and continues to participate in the company’s governance. The ticketing business has been recognized under the equity method since December 1, 2024. The impact of this disposal is not material in the 2024 results. In 2025, it will represent a decrease of around €10 million in current operating income. FRENCH COMPETITION AUTHORITY The decision of the French Competition Authority, published on December 19, 2024, set the amount of the fine imposed on Fnac Darty at the end of the settlement procedure at €109 million. Since the Group had already recorded a provision of €85 million in the second quarter of 2023, an additional charge of €24 million was recognized in 2024, with no impact on current operating income. The Group's short term financing will ensure the settlement of the transaction, which is expected to take place in 2025. GOVERNANCE AND SHAREHOLDERS As of December 31, 2024, Vesa Equity Investment was the Group’s largest shareholder with 28.28% of the capital 17 , followed by Ceconomy with 21.95% of the capital and GLAS SAS on behalf of ICG with 10.22% of the capital. On January 29, 2025, Unieuro, which is now part of the Fnac Darty group, appointed its new Board of Directors, of which Enrique Martinez becomes Chairman. Maria Bruna Olivieri has also been appointed chief executive officer Italy of Fnac Darty and thus joins the Executive Committee. The Board of Directors of Fnac Darty will propose to the General Meeting the renewal of Jacques Veyrat, Sandra Lagumina and Caroline Grégoire Sainte Marie be renewed at the General Meeting, as well as the ratification of the cooption of Stefano Meloni as Director, replacing Nonce Paolini, who passed away in July 2024. DIVIDENDS Fnac Darty will propose to the General Meeting scheduled for May 28, 2025 the approval of the distribution of a dividend of €1.00 per share , an increase of 55 cents compared to 2023. This amount represents a 40% payout ratio, calculated on the net income from continuing operations, Group share – adjusted 18 . This is in line with previous years and with the shareholder return policy presented in the strategic plan Everyday. The ex date is July 2, 2025 and the payment date is July 4, 2025. 2025 OUTLOOK The presentation of a new strategic plan will take place in June 2025 and will allow Unieuro to be included in the update of the Group's medium term objectives. The Group is approaching 2025 with confidence and anticipates a \"mid single digit” growth in its Current Operating Income (COI) excluding Unieuro, compared to 2024 COI excluding ticketing activities 19 . ********* PRESENTATION OF ANNUAL RESULTS 2024 Enrique Martinez, Chief Executive Officer and Jean Brieuc Le Tinier, Group Chief Financial Officer, will host a virtual presentation of the results in French, with simultaneous interpretation into English, on February 26, 2025 at 6:30 p.m. (Central European Time); 5:30 p.m. (UK); 12:30 p.m. (East Coast USA).

MONITORING OF THE NON FINANCIAL INDICATORS OF THE EVERYDAY PLAN DEFINITIONS OF ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THE APPLICATION OF THE IFRS 16 STANDARD On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16 on “Leases.” IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 and its interpretations. This standard, which is mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, requires the recognition of an asset (the right of use) and a liability (leasing debt) on the basis of discounted in substance fixed lease payments. The Group has applied IFRS 16 since January 1, 2019. In order to ensure the transition between IAS 17 and IFRS 16, all lease and service agreements falling within the scope of 16 have been analyzed. To monitor its financial performance, the Group publishes indicators that exclude the application of IFRS 16. These indicators are current EBITDA excluding IFRS 16, free cash flow from operations excluding IFRS 16, and net financial debt excluding IFRS 16. 1 Fnac Darty 2024 activity excluding Unieuro: Current Operating Income of at least €180 million and 2021–2024 cumulative free cash flow from operations of €500 million (excluding IFRS 16) 2 Proposal subject to the approval of the General Meeting of May 28, 2025 3 Pro forma (unaudited): Group reported data (12 months Fnac Darty + 1 month Unieuro) + 11 months of Unieuro data (January to November 2024) 4 For the full year by 2026 5 Impact of the deconsolidation of the Ticketing business on COI: around €10 million. 6 Fnac Darty 2024 activity excluding Unieuro 7 Unaudited: Group reported data (12 months Fnac Darty + 1 month Unieuro) + 11 months of Unieuro data (January to November 2024) 8 Like for like basis – LFL: excludes the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in scope, and store openings and closures. 9 Corresponds to the current net income, Group share of continuing operations, and adjusted for the additional charge relating to the transaction with the French Competition Authority (€24 million) and a goodwill impairment on Belgium (€15 million). 10 Fnac Darty 2024 activity excluding Unieuro 11 Like for like basis – LFL: excludes the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in scope, and store openings and closures. 12 Market data for 2024 published by Banque de France on January 20, 2025. 13 Like for like basis – LFL: excludes the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in scope, and store openings and closures 14 Fnac Darty 2024 activity excluding Unieuro 15 The decision of the French Competition Authority, published on December 19, 2024, set the amount of the fine imposed on Fnac Darty at the end of the settlement procedure at €109 million.

      "content": "STMicroelectronics annonce un récepteur de navigation par satellite innovant afin de démocratiser le positionnement de haute précision pour les applications automobiles et industrielles ST est le premier à intégrer une conception quadri bande et multi constellations, nécessaire pour le positionnement GNSS de haute précision de l’ordre de quelques centimètres, sur une seule puce. Cette conception innovante assure une solution de positionnement précis au coût optimisé pour les usagers de la route et pour de nouvelles applications industrielles, afin d’augmenter les zones où les véhicules autonomes peuvent opérer. Genève (Suisse), le 26 février 2025 — STMicroelectronics (NYSE : STM) , un leader mondial des semiconducteurs dont les clients couvrent toute la gamme des applications électroniques, a introduit la famille Teseo VI de récepteurs GNSS ( Global Navigation Satellite System ) destinés à des applications de positionnement de haute précision et à grands volumes. Pour l’industrie automobile, les puces et modules Teseo VI constitueront les éléments de base des systèmes avancés d’aide à la conduite (ADAS), des systèmes intelligents embarqués dans les véhicules et des applications critiques pour la sécurité, telles que la conduite autonome. Ces circuits ont également été conçus pour améliorer les capacités de positionnement dans de nombreuses applications industrielles, parmi lesquelles les systèmes de suivi d’actifs, les robots mobiles pour les livraisons à domicile, la gestion des machines et la surveillance des cultures dans le domaine de l’agriculture intelligente, les systèmes de synchronisation temporelle tels que les stations de base, et bien d’autres encore. « Nos nouveaux récepteurs Teseo VI représentent une véritable avancée parmi les moteurs de positionnement pour plusieurs raisons : ils sont les premiers à intégrer une fonction de traitement de signal multi constellations et quadri bandes sur une seule puce ; ils sont les premiers à intégrer une architecture à double cœur Arm® permettant à la fois des performances très élevées et une sécurité de niveau ASIL pour les applications de conduite assistée et autonome. Et enfin, ils intègrent la mémoire non volatile embarquée propriétaire de ST (PCM), offrant ainsi une plateforme très intégrée, rentable et fiable pour de nouvelles solutions de positionnement de haute précision » a déclaré Luca Celant, directeur général Digital Audio & Signal Solutions, STMicroelectronics. « Ces nouveaux récepteurs de navigation par satellite de ST prendront en charge des fonctionnalités avancées et passionnantes dans les applications ADAS pour l’automobile et permettront la mise en œuvre de nombreux nouveaux cas d'utilisation par les entreprises industrielles ». Teseo VI est le premier produit sur le marché à intégrer tous les éléments nécessaires au système pour atteindre un niveau de précision au centimètre sur une seule puce, et à prendre simultanément en charge des opérations multi constellations et quadri bandes. Cette innovation simplifie le développement de produits de navigation et de positionnement pour les utilisateurs finaux, améliore la fiabilité même dans des conditions difficiles comme les canyons urbains, et réduit les coûts des composants. De plus, l’intégration sur une seule puce permet d’accélérer les délais de mise sur le marché dans des formats compacts et légers. La nouvelle famille de récepteurs de positionnement haute précision Teseo VI s’appuie sur l’expérience acquise par ST depuis plusieurs décennies et intègre plusieurs technologies propriétaires de la Société, notamment dans les domaines du positionnement de haute précision et des mémoires embarquées avancées. Complément d’information technique à l’attention des rédacteurs La nouvelle famille de récepteurs GNSS de ST comprend les références Teseo VI STA8600A et Teseo VI+, STA8610A , chacune avec deux cœurs de processeur Arm® Cortex® M7 indépendants pour le contrôle local de l’ensemble des fonctions du circuit intégré. Le Cortex M7 apporte une puissante capacité de traitement 32 bits et permet une opération multi constellations et multi bandes simultanée sur une seule puce. Le Teseo VI+ peut également héberger divers moteurs de positionnement perfectionnés, développés indépendamment par des entreprises partenaires agréés par ST, afin de fournir une cinématique en temps réel complète, avec un niveau de précision de positionnement au centimètre près. Complétant la famille, le Teseo APP2 STA9200MA fonctionne avec deux cœurs en mode de traitement synchrone ( lockstep ), offrant une redondance matérielle pour des applications telles que le guidage des véhicules sur route conformément à la norme de sécurité fonctionnelle ISO 26262, niveau d’intégrité ASIL B. La compatibilité de brochage entre les récepteurs Teseo APP2 et les autres circuits intégrés Teseo VI simplifie la conception des circuits imprimés par les entreprises produisant des applications certifiées ASIL et non ASIL. Toutes les variantes se caractérisent par l’architecture RF innovante de ST et la conception de bande de base GNSS qui offre un support GNSS quadri bandes (L1, L2, L5 et E6) avec la capacité unique d’acquérir et de suivre uniquement la bande L5. Ceci est très efficace pour réduire les valeurs aberrantes et augmenter la robustesse dans des conditions difficiles telles que les canyons urbains et en présence de brouilleurs. Par ailleurs, la technologie propriétaire de mémoires à changement de phase (PCM — Phase Change Memory ) évite d’utiliser les besoins de mémoire externe, ce qui réduit la nomenclature du système (BOM) et simplifie la chaîne d’approvisionnement de fabrication. La PCM propriétaire, robuste pour résister à des environnements difficiles tels que l’automobile, est une mémoire non volatile de type Flash et possède une architecture à petites cellules adaptée à une intégration sur puce de faible encombrement. Les circuits intégrés contiennent tous un ensemble complet de fonctionnalités de cybersécurité matérielle, parmi lesquelles le démarrage sécurisé, la mise à jour du firmware par liaison radio et la protection des données de sortie. De plus, le module de sécurité matérielle (HSM) de ST assure une protection robuste contre le piratage en ligne. Ces composants sont conformes aux dernières spécifications UNECE R155 ( United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ) et à la norme ISO 21434 qui imposent la cybersécurité dès la conception. La famille de produits Teseo VI bénéficie d’un solide écosystème de fournisseurs et de partenaires pour les algorithmes, les conceptions de référence et le matériel complémentaire compatible. La famille de produits Teseo VI comprend également deux nouveaux modules GNSS pour l’automobile : le Teseo VIC6A au format 16 mm x 12 mm (intégrant Teseo VI) et le Teseo ELE6A au format 17 mm x 22 mm (intégrant Teseo VI+). Ces nouveaux modules simplifient l’intégration des circuits intégrés Teseo VI/VI+ sur la plateforme du client et garantissent des performances optimales. Des échantillons du récepteur Teseo VI sont disponibles sur demande.

Although the decline was not deep enough to trigger increased lending activities immediately, the persistent market uncertainty might give real estate investors something to cheer about one of these days. ETFs are a great way to stock up now to reap the benefits of MBS later. Three MBS backed ETFs that combine high credit quality with attractive yields, are: Vanguard Mortgage Backed Securities ETF VMBS : VMBS seeks to track the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. MBS Float Adjusted Index, primarily investing in U.S. agency mortgage backed pass through securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The fund offers a low expense ratio of 0.04% and provides investors with a diversified portfolio of MBS. Simplify MBS ETF MTBA : Launched in November 2023, MTBA focuses on higher coupon MBS, aiming to provide enhanced yield and total return potential. The fund invests in To Be Announced (TBA) contracts, which are MBS forward contracts offering improved liquidity and operational simplicity. MTBA is designed to capitalize on dislocations in the MBS market and offers a yield of nearly 6%. The expense ratio is even lower at 0.25%. Schwab Mortgage Backed Securities ETF SMBS : SMBS provides exposure to U.S. agency mortgage backed securities, aiming to track the performance of the Bloomberg US MBS Index. The fund offers investors access to a diversified portfolio of MBS with a competitive expense ratio of 0.03%, making it a viable option for those seeking income diversification. Also Read: Mortgage Rates Fall For Fifth Week Straight, But Remain Close To 7% Word Of Caution Investors should assess their individual risk tolerance and investment objectives before considering MBS ETFs, as these securities are subject to interest rate risk and prepayment risk. What Happened? The recent decline in mortgage rates is largely attributed to a drop in Treasury yields, as investors seek safe havens amid market volatility and economic data indicating weak consumer and business sentiment. The 10 year Treasury yield fell to 4.28% on Tuesday, its lowest since mid December, driven by concerns over U.S. economic growth and weak consumer and business sentiment. Despite the decline in rates, borrowing costs and home prices remain high. The average 30 year fixed mortgage rate of 6.88% is still a modest decrease from last week, insufficient to significantly boost borrowing, according to Financial Times. This led to a 3.6% decrease in refinancing applications and a marginal increase in home purchase applications, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and cited by Bloomberg. The MBA survey, conducted weekly since 1990, encompasses responses from mortgage bankers, commercial banks and thrifts, covering over 75% of all retail residential mortgage applications in the U.S. However, near term inflation expectations have risen due to anticipated impacts from President Trump’s tariffs, with two year break even rates reaching their highest levels since early 2023. In this environment, MBS ETFs present a potential opportunity for investors seeking to diversify their bond portfolios and capitalize on the current market dynamics.

      "content": "A BELOVED grocery chain has announced a massive u turn on its store openings plan – and instead employees will be axed.The company had previously announced plans to open over 50 stores this year alone – but now plans to half that number. GettyThe company had previously announced plans to open over 50 stores this year alone – but now plans to half that number[/caption]Grocery Outlet will undergo the huge restructuring that is likely to cost them millions, whilst facing a similarly huge profit drop off.Grocery Drive reported the revised plan, which saw the chain go from a plan of opening 50 to 55 new stores to 33 to 35.This will mean axing an unspecified number of employees and cancelling planned improvements to warehouses. They will also terminate several leases in “suboptimal locations”.The $52million $61million project was started in Grocery Outlet’s fourth quarter in 2024, a year that “urgently” needs improving upon according to the Chairman Eric Lindberg.He said: “On the surface, this is a simple business that performs very well when operations are executed properly.“2024 was a year in which many critical operational elements were out of sync, which was further exacerbated by trying to do too much, too fast.“But we’re working urgently to get back on track.“A more narrowed focus to new store openings will allow our infrastructure to more effectively support our expansion efforts.”He also added that “while we’re focused on ways to value engineer these costs down, it will take us some time to test and achieve a lower cost store build.” The CEO of Grocery Outlet, Jason Potter, said: “We worked hard there to build a service culture and really working as a team on a clear, defined strategy.“For sure, those are things I’ll take forward in my thinking here.“These challenges and opportunities are familiar territory for me, as I’ve spearheaded multiple turnarounds across many grocery models.“In each case, we were successful in driving sales profitability and ultimately returns for all stakeholders by improving collaboration, execution and the customer experience.”Grocery Outlet struggled in 2024, raking in nearly half of the income it did in 2023, going from $79.4million to $39.5million.The company ended the 2024 financial year with an over 11% increase in its general and administrative expenses.US braces for '45,000 store closures'Some 45,000 bricks and mortar stores could close in the next five years, experts have warned.Several major retailers have announced store closures or gone out of business altogether in recent years.In 2023, chains such as Foot Locker announced plans to close up to 400 outlets by 2026.While, other well known retailers like Tuesday Morning and Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Bed Bath & Beyond has closed all of its brick and mortar stores and is now an online only retailer.The most affected retailers have been clothing, consumer electronics, sporting goods, hobby, book, music, and home furnishing stores since the start of 2019.UBS has predicted the total number of retail stores will drop by 45k from 958k to 913k.Despite that, the report says that certain stores should thrive while others decline.It said retailers such as Walmart, Costco, Home Depot, and Target, could be among the winners.It is thought that the high number is due to the added cost of the restructure plan.They also ended last year with a total debt of $478million. However, Grocery Outlet did see net sales increase 10% and comparable store sales tick up nearly 3% compared to the prior year.The company is also scaling back on its plan to expand its distribution structure. They have walked back on building a multi temperature distribution center, according to Lindberg.It is unknown if and when more details on those being laid off from Grocery Outlet will be announced. As of January 2025, Grocery Outlet had 509 locations in the US, with 55%, or 279, of them being in California specifically.

The Acquisition adds stable annual production of 50,000 boe/d (1) (75% gas and 25% liquids) and approximately 1.1 million (770,000 net) acres of land in the southeast portion of the Deep Basin trend in Alberta , and includes four operated gas plants with total capacity of 102 mmcf/d. This footprint is contiguous and complementary to Vermilion's legacy Deep Basin assets, providing significant operational and corporate synergies. Vermilion has identified over 700 future drilling locations on the acquired acreage, across multiple zones including the Ellerslie , Notikewin, Rock Creek , Falher , Cardium, Wilrich and Niton formations, with half cycle IRRs ranging from 40% to over 100% based on estimates provided by McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd (\"McDaniel\") (2) . With this depth and quality of inventory, Vermilion expects the acquired assets to have the ability to maintain flat production for over 15 years while generating significant free cash flow (3) to enhance the Company's long term return of capital framework. Included in the Arrangement Agreement was an option for Westbrick shareholders to elect to receive up to a maximum of 1.7 million Vermilion common shares not to exceed $25 million in value as a portion of the total consideration. Certain shareholders of Westbrick have elected to receive Vermilion common shares totaling 1.1 million shares at a value of $14.2 million . The remainder of the consideration for the Acquisition will be paid in cash, funded through cash on hand, Vermilion's new $450 million term loan, and Vermilion's undrawn $1.35 billion revolving credit facility. Vermilion will provide updated 2025 budget and financial guidance reflecting the increased scale of the Company following the Acquisition with the release of its Q4 2024 results on March 5, 2025 . Q4 2024 Release Date and Conference Call Details Vermilion will release its 2024 fourth quarter and year end operating and financial results, along with its 2024 reserves information on Wednesday, March 5, 2025, after the close of North American markets.

Such forward looking statements or information are based on a number of assumptions, all or any of which may prove to be incorrect. In addition to any other assumptions identified in this document, assumptions have been made regarding, among other things: the ability of Vermilion to obtain equipment, services and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities in Canada and internationally; the ability of Vermilion to market crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the timing and costs of pipeline and storage facility construction and expansion and the ability to secure adequate product transportation; the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals; the ability of Vermilion to obtain financing on acceptable terms; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; future crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices; management's expectations relating to the timing and results of exploration and development activities; the impact of Vermilion's dividend policy on its future cash flows; credit ratings; the ability of Vermilion to effectively maintain its hedging program; expected earnings/(loss) and adjusted earnings/(loss); expected earnings/(loss) or adjusted earnings/(loss) per share; expected future cash flows and free cash flow and expected future cash flow and free cash flow per share; estimated future dividends; financial strength and flexibility; debt and equity market conditions; general economic and competitive conditions; ability of management to execute key priorities; and the effectiveness of various actions resulting from the Vermilion's strategic priorities. Although Vermilion believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements or information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because Vermilion can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Financial outlooks are provided for the purpose of understanding Vermilion's financial position and business objectives, and the information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements or information are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by Vermilion and described in the forward looking statements or information. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the ability of management to execute its business plan; the risks of the oil and gas industry, both domestically and internationally, such as operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; risks and uncertainties involving geology of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas deposits; risks inherent in Vermilion's marketing operations, including credit risk; the uncertainty of reserves estimates and reserves life and estimates of resources and associated expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production and associated expenditures; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects; constraints at processing facilities and/or on transportation; Vermilion's ability to enter into or renew leases on acceptable terms; fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and inflation; health, safety, and environmental risks and uncertainties related to environmental legislation, hydraulic fracturing regulations and climate change; uncertainties as to the availability and cost of financing; the ability of Vermilion to add production and reserves through exploration and development activities; the possibility that government policies or laws may change or governmental approvals may be delayed or withheld; weather conditions, political events and terrorist attacks; uncertainty in amounts and timing of royalty payments; risks associated with existing and potential future law suits and regulatory actions against or involving Vermilion; and other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this document or in Vermilion's other filings with Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The forward looking statements or information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof and Vermilion undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws. This document contains metrics commonly used in the oil and gas industry. These oil and gas metrics do not have any standardized meaning or standard methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used and should therefore not be used to make comparisons. Natural gas volumes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent. Barrels of oil equivalent (boe) may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Financial data contained within this document are reported in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated. Estimates of Drilling Locations: Unbooked drilling locations, including those associated with the Acquisition, are the internal estimates of Vermilion based on Vermilion's prospective acreage and the acreage that may be acquired pursuant to the Acquisition and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review. Unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources (including contingent and prospective). Unbooked locations have been identified by Vermilion's management as an estimation of Vermilion's multiyear drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic, seismic, engineering, production and reserves information including expected activities if the Acquisition is completed. There is no certainty that Vermilion will drill all unbooked drilling locations and if drilled there is no certainty that such locations will result in additional oil and natural gas reserves, resources or production. The drilling locations on which Vermilion will actually drill wells, including the number and timing thereof is ultimately dependent upon completion of the Acquisition, the availability of funding, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results, additional reservoir information that is obtained and other factors. While a certain number of the unbooked drilling locations have been de risked by Westbrick drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations, other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management of Vermilion has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves, resources or production. Reserves Data: There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves. The reserve and associated cash flow information incorporated in this release, including those relating to the reserves to be acquired pursuant to the Acquisition, are estimates only. Generally, estimates of economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves (including the breakdown of reserves by product type) and the future net cash flows from such estimated reserves are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, production rates, ultimate reserve recovery, timing and amount of capital expenditures, marketability of oil and natural gas, royalty rates, the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary materially from actual results. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable crude oil, NGL and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary. Vermilion's actual production, revenues, taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates and such variations could be material.

      "content": "Residents in the West Freemason Historic District will no longer be able to rent out their houses as vacation rentals under websites like Airbnb and Vrbo. The Norfolk City Council unanimously approved a zoning text amendment removing the use of vacation rentals in the two zoning districts that make up the neighborhood during a Tuesday meeting. The vote comes despite only a single vacation rental address being registered to operate in the zoning districts. However, several more are listed on vacation rental websites like Airbnb. The registered property will now have to cease operations when its conditional use permit expires in 2028. The owner of the registered vacation rental did not respond to a request for comment. Norfolk has 200 registered short term rentals, according to city data , with most located in either Ocean View or East Beach — 132 rentals are located in related civic league areas. Vacation rentals were approved in West Freemason in 2020 after a request from several interested property owners, according to the city. The West Freemason ban was supported by several residents and members of the Freemason Street Area Association civic league, who showed up to the City Council meeting to answer questions but did not speak. The residents said previously they believe vacation rentals clog up on street parking spots, harm the historic houses and attract parties. West Freemason Area Association President Jack Kavanaugh said after the meeting he was happy with the vote result. “That’s what we asked for,” Kavanaugh said. Vacation rentals are also banned in other city designated historic districts like Ghent and East Freemason, according to Planning Director Bobby Tajan.
